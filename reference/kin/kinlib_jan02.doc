  This documentation is divided into five parts:
 
      1. a DIRECTORY giving the following informations for each
generator:
 
* ALEPH NAME * ORIG. NAME * CODE # *        CONTACTS       * DATE *
 
   Informations on existing event files are kept in the ALEPH Monte
Carlo data logbook
                   ALEPHMC LOGBOOK M on IBM/VM
               KIN:ALEPHMC.LOGBOOK   on VAX/VMS.
 Or type MCLIST on IBM.
 
      2. a LOGBOOK giving a short description of each generator, with
emphasis on their characteristics, limits of validity and parameters.
 The generators are classified, depending on their physics subject, as
follows:
 
                                             code number (IGCOD)
                                             ___________________
 
  (i)   Zero mass particle final state    :      1000 + xx (xx = 1,2,..)
     (examples: e+e- ---> gamma gamma,
      gamma neutrino anti-neutrino, ..)
 
  (ii)  Bhabhas                           :      2000 + xx
 
  (iii) Muon-pair production              :      3000 + xx
 
  (iv)  Tau-pair production               :      4000 + xx
 
  (v)   Quark production and more
     generally f-fbar production          :      5000 + xx
     (example :e+e- ---> q qbar (+g..))
 
  (vi)  Gamma-Gamma interaction           :      6000 + xx
     (including deep inelastic scattering
      like e gamma process, etc.)
 
  (vii) Other physics processes           :      7000 + xx
 
  (viii) Background processes             :      8000 + xx
 
      3. a LOGBOOK of stand-alone programs which are not event generators
but codes which may be used to compute cross-sections , asymmetries.....
They are labelled as $$$$ in the general directory and the corresponding
documentation can be found in the specific part.
 
      4. a LOGBOOK of facilities which are not event generators but
code which may be used inside event generators to perform special tasks.

6. comments   :
 
 Problem found in the code by T. Wildish (RHC) : there seems to be an
inconsistancy between the code and the paper of the above reference.
 It was found to give troubles later for the calculated weights and
was thus corrected.

1. code i.d.  : Original version EEGGGG, from Patrick Janot (CERN)

2. Write-up   :
    This program is a Monte-Carlo generator to simulate the
    e+ e-  --> 4 photons process. It is based on the exact
    matrix element from Kleiss et al. This matrix element has
    been computed in the me = 0 limit, and can thus not be
    used when the propagators take values of the order of me**2.
 
    As a consequence, this program can only be used to generate
    four photon final state with photons above a minimum energy
    and above a minimum polar angle (i.e. in a given detector
    acceptance). If the chosen values are too small for the
    program to give reliable results, it stops. This only happens
    for very small values (polar angle below 1 degree and energy
    below 1E-3*beam energy).
 
    The event generation must be done in two steps. A first run
    must be dedicated to the determination of the maximum weight
    value. This value is then given to the code via a data card
    (see below) and unweighted events are then delivered.

*  Generator parameters
*
* ECMS   :  The centre-of-mass energy (GeV)
* XMIN   :  The minimal energy for the 4 photons, XMIN = Ei/EBEAM
* TETMIN :  The minimal polar angle for the four photons (in degrees)
* GRTMIN :  The minimal polar angle for three of the four photons
*           (in degrees), the fourth being limited by TETMIN
*           [e.g. three photons in the barrel, and one allowed
*            to be detected in the endcap too...]
* DELMIN :  The minimal angle between any two photons (in degrees)
* WMAX   :  Maximum weight value.
*           The program must be run first with WMAX = 0. The
*           events are weighted in this case, but the programs
*           returns the maximum weight value to be included
*           in this card file. When WMAX is given this value
*           the generated events are unweighted.
* IPRINT : the debug level (for experts only)
*
* *** XMIN and TETMIN MUST be non-zero. DELMIN can be zero
*     since the cross section has no singularity associated
*     to this variable. GRTMIN has to be larger than or equal
*     to TETMIN.

                interfaced in May 1988;
                contact people : M. Martinez, P.Gay and G. Bonneaud;
 
2. write-up   :
   The authors are M. Martinez and C. Mana, in collaboration with F.A.
Berends and G.J.H. Burgers (Barcelona 1986). Some modifications have been
introduced by Pascal Gay (Clermont-ferrand 1988).
   The programm calculates the reaction
                 e+ e- ----> nu nubar gamma (gamma).
   In the case of a (nu nu_bar gamma) event (one photon only in the final
state), the photon which simulates the "single photon" is generated in a
cone limited by the angle ACDIN (degrees) and its energy is greater than
EDLIN (in GeV).
   In the case of a (nu nu_bar gamma gamma) event (two photons in the
final state), the photon which simulates the "single photon" is generated
also in a cone limited by the angle ACDIN (degrees) and its energy is
greater than EDLIN (in GeV); the second photon is generated according to
a polar angle taken between ACMIN and 180.-ACMIN degrees. However, to
avoid problems (namely bias coming from the generation) and to really
take into account the resolution, acceptance, ..., of the apparatus, the
energy of this second photon is generated between the kinematical maximal
value and the minimal possible value (namely EMHIN). In any case ,such
events will go through the Detector simulation and will be kept , or not,
depending on the final acceptance . According to theoretical reasons, the
value of EMHIN should not be less than about 1% of the beam energy.

   Parameter bank 'KPAR' contains 9 real*4 values corresponding to :
         CMEIN, NFIN, EDLIN, ACDIN, EMHIN, ACMIN, SVRT(1:3).

nu nu_bar gamma events, = 2 for nu nu_bar gamma gamma events).
 
   Weight = 1 (the events are generated without weight).
 
   Center of mass energy ECMS = 2.*EBEAM - photon energies.
 
6. comments   :
 6.1 Some physical constants (or parameters) are fixed in the routine
PARAMS, i.e. the Z mass, Z width, sin(Theta_weak), particles masses,....
As the results are strongly dependent on the actual values of these para-
meters, the user has to check them carefully and to change them as wished
The default values are equal to those given in the table of constants as
defined for ALEPH in this documentation.
 
 6.2 The minimum value EMHIN of the energy of the "second" photon in the
final state (nu nu_bar gamma gamma) must be of the order or greater than
1% of the beam energy. In the future, a new version of this generator
using exponential technique (n photons in the final state) will allow a
decrease of this value; M. Martinez and R. Miquel are working on this
problem (P. Gay, May 1988).

   Some technical modifications, concerning the interfacing with the
ALEPH apparatus, are introducted by P. GAY (Clermont-ferrand 1988-1989)
 
   The programm calculates the reaction
                 e+ e- ----> nu nubar gamma (gamma).
   In the case of a (nu nu_bar gamma) event (one photon only in the final
state), the photon which simulates the "single photon" is generated in a
cone limited by the angle ACDIN (degrees) and its energy is greater than
EDLIN (in GeV).
   In the case of a (nu nu_bar gamma gamma) event (two photons in the
final state), the photon which simulates the "single photon" is generated
also in a cone limited by the angle ACDIN (degrees) and its energy is
greater than EDLIN (in GeV); the second photon is generated according to
a polar angle taken between ACMIN and 180.-ACMIN degrees. However, to
avoid problems (namely bias coming from the generation) and to really
take into account the resolution, acceptance, ..., of the apparatus, the
energy of this second photon is generated between the kinematical maximal
value and the minimal possible value (namely EMHIN). In any case ,such
events will go through the Detector simulation and will be kept , or not,
depending on the final acceptance .
 
   This version of this generator  e+ e- ---> nu nu_bar gamma gamma is
using the exponentiation technique of the soft photon in the initial
state, thus the value the soft/hard cut could be decreased as low as
needed.

   It is the full O(alpha) QED calculation for the process

   Since electroweak effects are not included, this generator is only
valid at low energies or sufficiently small angles (in the region of 40 -
90 mrad, corresponding to the luminosity monitors, and close to the Z,
the maximum electroweak effects are maximal and of the order of +/- 5%).
   This event generator is relativly simple and fast; it has been used
and compared to data in many PETRA/PEP experiments.

     (B. Bloch, November 8, 1988).

     The old result, thats known to be inadequate for small q**2 like in
     forward Bhabha scattering,can still be obtained by putting DISPFL to
     false.
     It uses the complex function FC(s,m1,m2) for leptons,top to get the
     threshold behaviour consistent in the imaginary part (and to write
     the routine more compact)
  timing : old pig  .15 msec /call
           new pig  .27 msec /call    DISPFL FALSE
           new pig  .15 msec /call    DISPFL TRUE
   The function  HADRQQ(S) corresponds to the calculation of the
   hadronic irreducible qq self-energy (transverse ), it parametrizes
   the real part of the photon self energy function by  a + b ln(1+C*|S|)
   as in the 1981 TASSO note but using updated values, extended using
   RQCD up to 100 TeV . For details see:

2. write-up   :
   This monte carlo event generator simulates, for t-channel dominated
configurations, the process e+ e- ---> e+ e- gamma (gamma).
   The calculation of this fourth order process is done on two different
regions which must be generated separately :
 the soft region - the second gamma has energy < CUTOFF (in c.m. frame)
                 - only one photon is generated
 the hard region - the second gamma has energy > CUTOFF (in c.m. frame)
   The author is Dean Karlen, Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (June
1987). The present version is the version # 7.1 which differes from
version 7.0 by the following changes :
  o form of 3rd order EPA cross section put in terms of invariants
  o add Martinez/Miquel matrix element for e-e-g-g (very CPU consumming)
  o allow generation of weighted events (useful for looking at
    distributions and calculating cross sections for many acceptances).
  o new configuration: GAMMAE, 4th order single photon with a (soft)
    electron in the acceptance.
  o new MTRXGG: HEEGG, a hybrid of EPADC and BEEGG
This code is very well documented, in particular useful informations are
given in the EEGG01 ORIGINE file, especially from line #362 to line #495.
 
   Three different configurations might be generated; depending on the
final state of interest, some input parameters have thus specific signi-
ficance :
 i) e-gamma final state (both an electron and a gamma are 'seen'):
      TEVETO - maximum theta of the 'missing' electron
      TEMIN  - minimum theta of the 'seen' electron  |TEMIN and/or
      TGMIN  - minimum theta of the 'seen' gamma     | TGMIN>TEVETO
      EEMIN  - minimum energy of the 'seen' electron
      EGMIN  - minimum energy of the 'seen' gamma
 ii) electron final state (only an electron is 'seen'):
      TEVETO - maximum theta of the 'missing' electron
      TEMIN  - minimum theta of the 'seen' electron   |TEMIN>TEVETO
      TGVETO - maximum theta of the 'missing' gamma(s)|TEMIN>TGVETO
      EEMIN  - minimum energy of the 'seen' electron
 iii) gamma final state (only a gamma is 'seen'):
      TEVETO - maximum theta of the 'missing' electrons
      TGMIN  - minimum theta of the 'seen' gamma       TGMIN>TEVETO

2. write-up   :
   This version supersedes the version transmitted by S. Jadach in June
1988; this is version number 1.1, May 1988 with additionnal corrections
from S. Jadach and B. Ward.
   BHLUMI is a BHABHA monte carlo with exponentiation in the initial and
in the final states (Yennie-Frautschi-Suura generator type).
   The authors are S. Jadach, Jagellonian University, Cracow, Poland,
and B.F.L. Ward, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Tennessee, U.S.A..
   This is a program for double tagged Bhabhas, at the angular regime
where the Z0 contribution is negligible. In fact, in the present version
no contribution of the s-channel Z0 is included (the interference between
t-channel photon and s-channel Z0 was included in the previous version in
the form of a correction only).
   This calculation has thus to be used essentially for luminosity mea-
surement. Two important parameters are XMIVIS and THMIN, respectively the
minimum energy and the minimum polar angle of the e+ and of the e-. The
recommended values have to be in the range
                       XMIVIS < 0.5 (in beam energy units)
                 1   < THMIN  < 150 mrads (near the Z0 resonance).
   The infrared cutoff EPSCM may be chosen arbitrarily low, but the
recommended range is the following :
                1E-4 < EPSCM  < 1E-3 .

6. comments   :
 6.1 WARNING : use this program in the domain of its applicability!!!
 6.2 This program is still in the stage of test and development and its
results should be treated with a great care (report any dubious result
to S. Jadach or B. Ward).
 6.3 During tests the program was running fairly well for THMIN between
1. and 50. milliradians.
 6.4 It may be used for studying topology of events but total cross
section is believable up to 2.0% before more tests are done.
 6.5 Comparison between this version (without any contribution of the Z0
exchange) and the previous one (where the contribution of the interferen-
ce between s-channel Z0 and t-channel photon was included in the form of
a correction only) shows that the two calculations are in agreement at
the level of 0.5% for the total cross section (10000 generated events).
     This version however has the advantage to avoid unphysical generated
events with negative or too large weights.
 6.6 The function REPI has been replaced in February 1990 by an improved
one as recommended by H.Burkhardt,to compute the vacuum polarization in
qed. The leptonic contribution is an analytical expression involving the
lepton mass; the hadronic contribution is a dispersion integral over the
known hadronic cross section.The result used here is a parametrization
given by  H.BURKHARDT, TASSO NOTE 192(1981)and  updated(see H.Burkhardt
et al. Pol. at Lep CERN 88-06 VOL I)
 Lepton masses are now fully taken into account (H.Burkhardt June 89)

2. write-up   :
   See BHAB01 and references herein for a description of the generator.
Considering this new version however, the improvements compared with the
original version of BABAMC are the following (R. Miquel - Barcelona) :
 
   2.1) Instead of putting the self energy corrections as a pure O(alpha)
correction, the photon and Z propagators have been modified to include
the effect of the self energies to all orders, both in the virtual + soft
part and in the hard one.
 
   2.2) The Z0 width is computed with the one loop electroweak and QCD
corrections, instead of the tree level calculation of the original
program. This modification is especially important when running at the Z
peak.
 
   2.3) Longitudinal beam polarizations have been included: the formulae
from reference 3.1 have been used to calculate the virtual + soft part
and those from reference 3.3 to calculate the hard cross-section.

 6.1 The correction to reject events with weight = 0. has been introduced

     (G. Bonneaud, November 23, 1988).

     use the hadron vacuum polarization as described in :
       H.Burkhardt et al. Pol. at Lep CERN 88-06 VOL I
     The old result, thats known to be inadequate for small q**2 like in
     forward Bhabha scattering,can still be obtained by putting DISPFL to
     false.
     It uses the complex function FC(s,m1,m2) for leptons,top to get the
     threshold behaviour consistent in the imaginary part (and to write
     the routine more compact)
  timing : old pig  .15 msec /call
           new pig  .27 msec /call    DISPFL FALSE
           new pig  .15 msec /call    DISPFL TRUE
   The function  HADRQQ(S) corresponds to the calculation of the
   hadronic irreducible qq self-energy (transverse ), it parametrizes
   the real part of the photon self energy function by  a + b ln(1+C*|S|)
   as in the 1981 TASSO note but using updated values, extended using
   RQCD up to 100 TeV . For details see:

2. write-up   :
   UNIBAB is a Monte Carlo generator for Bhabha events in the central
region. It includes higher order QED corrections by strictly implementing
the leading logarithmic terms to all orders. The program uses a factori-
zation scheme, separating initial-state QED radiation, the hard scatter-
ing process, and final-state QED radiation. Weak corrections are included
by modifying the Born cross section of the hard scattering.
   The overall precision is better than 1 %, to be compared with other
MC generators (BABAMC: about 5 %) and semi-analytical programs (ALIBABA:
0.5 %).

2. write-up   : newest version of BHLUMI (version 4.04) from S.Jadach et al ,
            which allows to quote a theoretical error of 0.11%
            in a SICAL-like acceptance.
            It includes improvements in the matrix element  of the
            multi-photon sub-generator ( YFS exponentiation) and takes
            contibution from the Z resonance into account .
            At LEP 2 , the typical error is quoted as 0.25% for an angular
            range between 1 and 6 degrees from the beam line .
               Two selections ( LCAL/SICAL) may be applied at generator level
            to compute the accepted cross-section in the defined acceptance
            and energy cuts ( see data cards ).

                interfaced in October/November 1996
                contact people : J von Wimmersperg, B Bloch. 

2. write-up   :
   BHWIDE is a Monte Carlo Event Generator for Bhabha scattering at large
(wide) angles with O(alpha) YFS exponentiation and O(alpha) virtual
(both weak and QED) corrections. The YFS exponentiation is realized via MC
methods based on a BHLUMI-type MC algorithm and the virtual corrections are
taken from the program ALIBABA. The final particle four-momenta for the entire
e+e- + ngamma final state are available for each event, which may be generated
as a weighted or unweighted event. The expected accuracy of the program is
anticipated at around 0.2% in the Z-region and 0.1% in the LEP2 regime.

6. comments   :
 6.1 In the present program the W mass and the electroweak mixing angle
are calculated from the (as yet) more accurately known value of the muon
lifetime. This is done by routine FINDMW (H. Burkhardt, December 1987).
 6.2 The correction to reject events with weight = 0. has been introduced
as proposed in ALEPH 88-139, PHYSIC 88-43, H. Burkhardt and E. Locci.
   Also, the correction to regularize the behaviour of the total cross
section as a function of the soft photon cutoff has been done (see Sub-
routine INFRA : BMU = DLOG(W/MMU)*2.D0-1.D0) (B. Bloch, November 8,1988).
 6.3 The function PIG(S) has been modified in February 1990 in order to
     use the hadron vacuum polarization as described in :
       H.Burkhardt et al. Pol. at Lep CERN 88-06 VOL I
     The old result, thats known to be inadequate for small q**2 like in
     forward Bhabha scattering,can still be obtained by putting DISPFL to
     false.
     It uses the complex function FC(s,m1,m2) for leptons,top to get the
     threshold behaviour consistent in the imaginary part (and to write
     the routine more compact)
  timing : old pig  .15 msec /call
           new pig  .27 msec /call    DISPFL FALSE
           new pig  .15 msec /call    DISPFL TRUE
   The function  HADRQQ(S) corresponds to the calculation of the
   hadronic irreducible qq self-energy (transverse ), it parametrizes
   the real part of the photon self energy function by  a + b ln(1+C*|S|)
   as in the 1981 TASSO note but using updated values, extended using
   RQCD up to 100 TeV . For details see:

2. write-up   :
   This monte carlo event generator generates the process
              e+ e- ---> fermion antifermion + up to 3 gammas
   up to O(alpha 3).It gives as well cross-section an asymetry.
 
  Authors are J.E. Campagne and R. Zitoun from LPNHE, University of
 Paris VI AND VII.
   The fermions may be leptons ( muons or taus , not electrons) or
 q qbar pairs.In the interface , the possibility of generating a mixture
 of quark flavors has been introduced.
   In case of tau production , the decay is performed by LUND ( which
 may be setup as defined by  TAU group).In case of quark pair production
 the program is interfaced with the LUND parton shower to produce final
 state particles.
  Three gammas may be produced : initial radiation from the electron
 and/or positron, final state radiation.
 One can switch on exponentiation of initial and/or final state radiation
 as well as 1st order calculation.A 10 Mev cut off is applied for final
 state photon.
  Final state radiation can also be suppressed on request

2. write-up   :
   This monte carlo event generator is an improved version of previous
 DYMU2 generator interfaced as DYMU01.
   The main difference is an improved version of the generation of the
 very hard photon spectrum.
 The possibility of generating a mixture of quark flavors has been kept.
   In case of tau production , the user may request that the program
 generates polarised decays into pion neutrino.
   If not ,the decay is performed by LUND ( which may be setup as defined
 by  TAU group).
  In case of quark pair production the program is interfaced with the
 LUND  parton shower to produce final state particles.
  Three gammas may be produced : initial radiation from the electron
 and/or positron, final state radiation.
 One can switch on exponentiation of final state radiation as well as 1st
 order calculation.A 10 Mev cut off is applied for final state photon.
  Final state radiation can also be suppressed on request
  Initial state exponentiation is always on now.

6. comments   :
 
   Parameters for the hadronisation in LUND may be modified by LUND data
cards as shown in LUND02 or HVFL01 documentations.
   It is recommended to load the modified LUND routines to benefit from
work done in Tau and heavy flavor fields.
   Comments may be send to the author by electronic mail :CAMPAGNE@CERNVM
   This version uses author's version #2.0 from November 1989.
   In the generator history, the initial quarks before parton shower
evolution are stored as well as after hadronisation.They are described
as coming from the initial qqbar system ( called Z0).The subsequent quark
is seen as coming from the initial quark, the antiquark as coming from
the initial antiquark.Gluons are labelled as coming from the initial 'Z0'
system.

2. write-up   :
   This version is version 3.4 of KORALZ. For basic description of the
tau's generation itself, the user should refer to KORL01 and references
herein. We concentrate here on the new basic features of the program.
   Let's remark that this new version is obviously backward compatible
to that previous version, which was noted 2.0.
  The basic new feature of the program is exponentiation of the initial
state bremsstrahlung in the form of the real photons (Ref. 3.5 and 3.6).
  In reference 3.7, it was shown that the interference between bremsstra-
hlung in the initial state and the final state is negligible near the top
of the Z0 resonance for the total cross section.This effect is fully used
(and more generally the fact that Z0 lifetime strongly reduces effects of
this interference for all obsevables) and QED final state bremsstrahlung
is treated as a subsequent phenomenon. In fact one generates single final
state bremsstrahlung photon according to the order alpha formulas (ref.
3.1).
  To connect effects of the final state  with that of the initial state
we will use intuition provided by the factorization of the leading log
QED corrections in the form of structure functions and exponentiation of
the infrared singularities. Namely we generate final state bremsstrahlung
in the rest frame of intermediate Z0, that is the system of colliding
virtual e+ and e-, where their 4-momenta differ by substraction of the
corresponding collinear initial state bremsstrahlung photons from that of
the beams. In this system electroweak corrections are also calculated in
agreement with ref. 3.2.
   In this way we can avoid troubles of interplay between bremsstrahlung
of initial state and electroweak corrections (see ref. 3.7).

2. write-up   :
   This version is version 3.4/01 of KORALZ. For basic description of
the tau's generation itself, the user should refer to KORL01 and KORL02
and references herein. We concentrate here on the new basic features of
the program which concern essentially the tau decay part and initialisa-
tion procedures.
 
   2.1 new decay modes
    Up to KORL02, only 5 decay modes of the tau were provided :
e nue nutau, mu numu nutau, pi nutau, rho nutau and A1 nutau.
    The present version adds (almost) all missing modes : K nutau,
K* nutau and multipion nutau (the only neglected mode is Q1 nutau).
    The branching ratios are taken from M.Davier compilation (ref 3.9).
 
 -  K and K* modes are just similar to pi and rho modes respectively
with the only exceptions of i) the 2 decay channels of the K* itself,
                           ii) a simple Breit Wigner for the K* shape.
Final state polarisation is included in the same way as it is for the
original decay channels in KORL01 and KORL02.
 
 -  multipion decay is not only phase space but matrix element a la
 YS.Tsai/Gilman-Rhie/C.Kiesling is included (a la TN.Pham et al for 5-pi
 decays)  (Ref 3.10)
Final state polarisation is ignored for multipion modes.
 
   2.2 Modifications to original KORL02 routines.
- Masses are uniquely defined in the routine INIMAS and transmitted
through the COMMON / PARMAS /.
The COMMON / DECPAR / is modified consequently.
 
- A1 decay into pi pi0 pi0 is explicitely generated (ie pi0 mass is
different from charged pi mass).
 
- Some "cosmetics" were applied to avoid duplication of code (DEXAY1
vs DEXAY2..), precision problems and multiple initialisations.
 
   2.3 New features
 - radiative corrections to tau decays are introduced
(except for A1 and multipion modes)
 
 - Unique random generator : RANMAR
 
 - Unique initialisation of QED, GSW and tau decay parameters from
 KORALZ

0. platforms : use a later version please
   additionnal code needed :
 
1. code I.D.  : original version (KORALZ-3.8) from Z. Was
                transmitted in December 1990
 
2. write-up   :
   It now includes the following possible final states:
       1 = TAU pair              2 = Muon pair
       3 = Neutrino pair       501 = u ubar pair
     502 = d dbar pair         503 = s sbar pair
     504 = c cbar pair         505 = b bbar pair
 
   Compared to KORL03 there is now a possibility to choose among 3 electroweak
   libraries:   DIZET ( Dubna-Zeuthen group version3.01)
                STUART
                HOLLIK
 
    if you use switch KEYWLB = 1 in data cards, then you should link with
                                DIZET or STUART
    if you use switch KEYWLB = 2 in data cards, then you should link with
                                HOLLIK
 
    For final states tau or mu ( ITFIN=1 or 2) one can use KEYWLB=1 or 2
    For other final states (ITFIN>2) one should use only KEYWLB =1
 
    DIZET library is intalled as ORIGINE (.ORIGINE) and TXTLIB (.OLB) on IBM
    and VAX KIN areas.
    STUART and HOLLIK libraries are installed under HISTORIAN on Vax and
    IBM KIN areas.They also exist as TXTLIB/.OLB to be linked toguether with
    KORL04.
 
    Final state particles masses are given in AMNEUT for ITFIN>2
        ITFIN = 3 AMNEUT = neutrino mass
        ITFIN > 3 AMNEUT = quark mass
 
    For now no quark fragmentation is provided, but it will come soon
 
    User will find some helpful information in the Data Cards file comments.

                TAUOLA (version 2.0, Dec 1991)
                revisited for multi-pion modes and radiative corrections
                transmitted by Z.Was February 1992
 
2. write-up   :
   See KORL04 for general description.
   Tau decay updates :
 
 2.1 Initialisations
   - Branching ratios :
       Set in INITDK as measured by ALEPH (CERN-PPE/91-186)
       (K Kbar pi and K pi pi modes are temporarily set to 0)
   - A1 mass and width : set to 1.251 and .599 respectively, as fitted
       by J.H.Kuhn et al (Z.Phys C48 (1990) 445, to restore consistency
       between matrix element used in decay routines and a1 parameters.
 2.2 Radiative corrections
     Exact first order radiative corrections in tau -> electron and muon
     decays are included. Approximate rad.corr. kept for other 1-prong
     decay modes.
 2.3 Multi pion modes
     4pi decays have been redesigned :
     -  Polarisation effects are taken into account
     -  3pi pi0 mode includes tau -> omega pi nu, omega -> pi+pi-pi0
        as 32% of (3pi pi0) decays

    4006 - KORL06
    *************
 
0. platforms : IBM ALWS AXP/VMS
   additionnal code needed : JETSET63 library ( and block data LUDATA
               and LUEDAT ), one library among DIZET,STUART,HOLLIK
               Better : use the next version KORL07
 
1. code I.D.  : original version (KORALZ-3.8 ) from Z. Was
                transmitted in December 1990
                TAUOLA (version 2.0, Dec 1991)
                revisited for multi-pion, KKpi, Kpipi and special modes
                and radiative corrections in tau decay
                transmitted by Z.Was December 1992.
                updated and installed by AM.Lutz December 1992
 
2. write-up   :
   See KORL04 for general description.
   Tau decay updates (with respect to KORL05) :
   A version number has been introduced to keep track of the modifications
   to the setup of KORL06 ( in particular changes in the BR's  )
   Production has started in 92 without this feature , and will be known as
   version 100. The first version with modified BR's is version 101.
   Version number and defined BR's are kept in header bank KORL ( see section
   Run Headers for a full description)
 
 2.1 Initialisations
   - Branching ratios :
     Set in INITDK as measured by ALEPH (1990-1992 data) and/or
     world best measurements (strange modes)
 2.2 Radiative corrections in tau decays
     KORL06 was reverted to the approximate rad.corr. in all tau decays,as it
     used to be up to KORL04, after extensive checks proved RADCOR and the
     exact matrix element results to be indistinguishable.
     The intermediate 4-momentum of the charged particle before radiation
     (if any) is stored on the output, with the Lund history code of a decaying
     particle (the Lund particle code remains unchanged). The final charged
     particle and radiative gamma are daughters of the intermediate state.
     (e, mu, pi, rho channels only)
 2.3 Multi pion modes
     - 4pi decays have been retuned to experimental data : new matrix element
       for tau -> omega pi nu, omega -> pi+pi-pi0
     - 5pions and 6pions decays have been splitted into :
          5pions = 3pi- 2pi+     (mode 10) and 3pi+- 2pi0 (mode 11)
          6pions = 3pi- 2pi+ pi0 (mode 12) and 3pi+- 3pi0 (mode 13)
       Decays are generated as before (n-pi total mass distributions is
       deduced from e+e- data ; then pi's are generated according to phase
       space)
 2.4 3pi, K K pi and K pi pi modes
     - a1 (3pi) coding has been technically revisited (mode 5)
       The physics input remains unchanged with respect to the previous versions
       but new physics will be easier to implement
     - 6 new modes have been implemented (modes 14 - 19)
        -> 14  =   K- pi- K+
        -> 15  =   K0 pi- K0B
        -> 16  =   K- pi0 K0
        -> 17  =   pi0 pi0 K-
        -> 18  =   K- pi- pi+
        -> 19  =   pi- K0B pi0
     - Polarisation effects are taken into account for all modes.
     - A unique scheme runs for all 3-body decays, all dynamics being
       confined into form factors (FORM1 to FORM5) depending on the
       decay channel and physics inputs.
 2.5 Other modes
       2 other decays modes are implemented :
        -> 20  =   eta pi- pi0   (eta decay is handled by JETSET routines)
        -> 21  =   pi- omega, omega -> pi0 gam
 
 The generated decay modes are now complete at the per mil level.
 For all but the 5- and 6-pion channels, polarisation effects are included.
 Two items are still missing : K Kbar mode (BR of the order of 10**-3)
                               omega pi resonance in the 3pi2pi0 mode

6. comments   :
   - Do not forget do load an electroweak library to be linked as an extra OLB/
     TXTLIB : STUART, DIZET or HOLLIK upon choice (according to data card GKOR)
   (the default setting  in the reference cards is :KEYWLB=1 ie STUART or DIZET)
   - LUNMOD must be linked to get correct Dalitz decays for pi0

6. comments   :
   - Do not forget do load an electroweak library to be linked as an extra
    OLB/TXTLIB : STUART (renamed Z0POLE_W), DIZET_W or HOLLIK_W upon
    choice (according  to data card GKR7)
   (the default setting in the reference cards is :KEYWLB=1 ie Z0POLE_W
    or DIZET_W)
   - GBOOK_K (for internal use ) have been incorporated to the KORL07 Library
   - JETSET7.3 must be linked

1. code I.D.  : original version (KORALZ-4.02) from Z. Was
                including TAUOLA (version 2.6, Aug 1995)
                Interfaced with PHOTOS for radiative corrections in tau
                decay
   
2. write-up   : This version is recommended for high energies ( above the
        Z peak ) . It should be used together with the electroweal Library
        DIZET_2 from the Dubna/Zeuten group version 5.9/5.0
        This version can be used in the usual tau and muon final states but
        also in the nu nubar option for multi photon final state . The quark
        option with hadronisation in the JETSET parton shower is also
        available.
        As in KORL07 , the electron option in the s-channel has been introduced.

  - the nu nubar gamma (gamma) final state, including or not the anomalous couplings
    Delta(kappa) and Lambda used in the description of the S.M. Anomalous W W gamma couplings.
    This option is the only one which has been fully tested within ALEPH.
    It provides an event generator where the effects of the anomalous couplings
    are stored as 6 weights for each event in a bank, KWTK, which is added to
    the event kinematics banks and transmitted through all ALEPH packages
    up to the MINIs. See the definition of the KWTK elements using 'sbank'.

  - the leptoquark final state. This option has not been tested in ALEPH.

  The reference below should be carefully read before using this generator, especially
  if one wishes to use the six event weights in the the nu nubar gamma (gamma) final state.

6. comments   :
    This version has been extensively tested in the nu nubar option (ITFIN=3).
  It is thought to be also valid for other final states but has not been tested !

and B. Bloch to fix the troubles found in BREM01.
   The original routines were modified to take into account the non-zero
masses of the produced fermions .
   Special care was taken to initialize all masses with coherent values
in BREM5 and LUND.
Access to the type of graph which generates the event is now possible.
 
 2.1 BREM5 can generate the following fermion-antifermion final states:
electron ,muon , tau or light quarks, b included. But :
 
        -electron will only have the s-channel diagramm.
        -tau and top will be decayed in LUND and this means that no final
state polarization will be taken into account.
   In the case of Tau pair production , the modified definition of decay
modes and branching ratios ( as defined by the Tau group ) may be used
in Lund.
 
 2.2 BREM5 has the capability of handling initial state polarization, but
only of the electrons. In that case it interrupts execution after half
the events have been processed and prints out the corresponding forward-
backward asymmetry and cross section. Then it flips the polarization and
generates the second half of the events.
 
 2.3 BREM5 has weighted events as output, the soft events (no hard radia-
tion) have a weight 1.
 
 2.4 BREM5 has a very interesting handling of weak radiative corrections:
All oblique corrections are included automatically by the '*-system'.
These corrections include the changes to sin2th , Mz , Mw , Gamz and Gamw
that are caused by the photon-z-w self energy diagrams.
   The interesting stuff in other words :
You can use BREM5 to get DeltaR, Mw, sinth*, rho*, gmu* etc.. as a func-
tion of Mz, MH, Mtop. Similarily for the leptons couplings. BREM5 also
takes into account first-order QED photonic effects, boxes and vertices.
 
 2.5 BREM5 is interfaced to LUND-Showers. There is one fundamental ques-
tion there , namely : ' who came first, the photon or the gluon?'
   This problem did not occur in the past for LUND since no one worried
about generating both final state photon and gluon emission.The present
program calculates photon emission first and then hadronizes.

6. comments   :
 
 6.1 This version was corrected in december 87 for a bug in  WKCORS.
 
 6.2 Scans in energy, which were feasible in the original program stored
    in BREM02 ORIGINE M (IBM/VM ) and KIN:BREM02.ORIGINE(VAX/VMS),are not
    feasible in the  kingalized version for now.
 
 6.3 The higgs,top,Z masses given as input parameters are relevant for
    the Electroweak corrections(The Lund corresponding part is not used).
    They are however transmitted to LUND for completeness.
    The final state fermion mass are defined to be the same as LUND ones.
    Defaults in LUND are u & d :0.325, s : 0.5, c : 1.6, b : 5.0 Gev.
 
 6.4 In case of tau production, it is possible to use the up-to-date
    branching ratios and decay modes as defined by the Tau group.Just
    answer(Y)when asked in the Panel if you need the modified Lund
    routines.
 
 6.5 It is possible to modify some values of Lund parameters,particularly
    the fragmentation scheme .  See the LUND02 section for a complete
    description.

    *************
 
0. platforms : IBM ALWS AXP/VMS
   additionnal code needed : JETSET63 library
               Better use a later version
 
1. code I.D.  : original version JETSET from the CERN library;
                taken from the Library;
                interfaced from March to July-October 1988;
                contact people : A.Falvard,D.Decamp,B. Bloch-Devaux.
 
2. write-up   :
  JETSET is part of the LUND MONTE CARLO PROGRAMS. This generator is the
JETSET version 6.3 :Jet fragmentation and e+ e- annihilation by T. Sjos-
trand and M.Bengtsson, Department of Theoretical Physics, University of
LUND (Sweden).
   The Long writeup of the program can be obtained from the DD documen-
tation office under #W5035 and should be read carefuly by the non expe-
rienced user before generating quark-antiquark pairs.
   The event generator called is LUEEVT (IFL,ECMS) with default values
IFL = 0 and ECMS = 92.2 GeV, the center of mass energy; a mixture of all
flavors ( 1...6) is obtained.
   If the user wants to specify a fixed flavor and/or change the ECMS,
it is possible to overwrite the default values. It is as well possible
to change the default values of many quantities of the Lund commons.
 
 The main improvement from original version is the introduction of mixing
for B mesons. The user can choose to have mixing or not, and if so the
mixing parameters are considered separatly for Bd and Bs.
 The time dependance of the mixing probability is taken into account
together with the decay probability.
 For completeness, CP violation effects in DeltaB=+-2 are also included.
 However, these effects are small compared to CP violation effects in
 B-decays.In that later case, B decays into a CP eigenstate.
 One can recognize later that mixing occured by looking at the mother of
the considered meson : in case of mixing ,the mother is also a B (B bar)
meson.
 2.1 Mixing : The parameters involved are xq , yq , where q refers to
   d or s flavor.
     xq = DeltaM/Gamma         , yq = DeltaGamma/2*Gamma
    The propability of mixing is then : (xq**2+yq**2)/2.*(1.+xq**2)
 
 2.2 Mixing and CP violation : the module and the phase enter here and
     modify the probability which becomes then different for B and Bbar
 
 2.3 CP violation in |Delta B|=1 decays:This look promising for final
     states which are CP eigenstates.The time evolution of B0 and B0bar
     are affected differently.

5. header informations :
 5.1 run header
   One parameter bank KPAR is created and data cards used as explained
above are also kept as BOS Banks at the beginning of the file. So it is
highly recommended to make use of this facility to modify default values
of the Lund parameters.
   Parameter bank 'KPAR' contains 18 or more real*4 values corresponding
   to :
     TABL(1) =IFL                         TABL(2) = ECMS
     TABL(3) =smearing of x_vertex        TABL(4) = smearing of y_vertex
     TABL(5) =smearing of z_vertex        TABL(6) = Xd

     TABL(16)=CSCPBA(Bsbar-->Bs)          TABL(18)= NPAR
    If NPAR is positive then
     TABL(19:18+NPAR)= ICODP(1:NPAR)      TABL(18+NPAR+1)=PMO
     TABL(18+NPAR+2) = PHA
 
   Integer values are stored as real; SVRT corresponds to the smearing of
the vertex position (in cm).
 
   CDCPBA,CDCPB,CSCPBA,CSCPB are the resulting probabilities for the
four processes :  Bd bar-->Bd , Bd --> Bd bar
         and      Bs bar-->Bs , Bs --> Bs bar
 
 5.2 event header
   Process identifier IDPR = Flavor code of the generated event(1 digit
per qqbar flavor ).
In case of mixed flavor run, the event is analysed to give in this word
the flavor generated (the second flavor generated in the event appears
as the lowest decimal digit, that is 21 means ddbar quarks plus a uubar
pair).
 
   Weight :can be ignored as all events have weight 1.
 
   Center of mass energy ECMS = as defined by the user in the Data card.

2. write-up   :
  HVFL01 may use different basic generators of  qqbar pairs.For now it is
interfaced with three basic qqbar producers :LUND 6.3 , BREM5 and DYMUS.
For general description of those three programs,the reader should look at
the specific documentations given in chapters  LUND02 for LUND6.3  ,
BREM02,BREM03 for BREM5 and DYMU02 for DYMUS.
  The idea of such a generator is to be able to build easily new features
specific to the Heavy Flavor Physics.
   The following options are provided:
  2.1 Choose qqbar generator:LUND6.3 , BREM5 or DYMUS with appropriate
definition of Flavor to be generated , Energy in C.M., Z0,TOP , HIGGs
masses .....
  2.2 In case of BREM5 and DYMUS,one can choose to generate unweighted
or weighted  events.

   Several parameter banks are created and data cards used to modify LUND
defaults as explained above are also kept as BOS Banks at the beginning
of the file. So it is highly recommended to make use of this facility to
modify them.
 
   Parameter bank 'KHVF' contains 11 real*4 values corresponding to :
      1 = IGENE                   2 = IFL

      11= IVERS (version#*100)              0 if standard used)
   Integer values are stored as real; SVRT corresponds to the smearing of
the vertex position (in cm).
 
   Parameter bank 'KBRE' contains 24 real*4 values corresponding to :

        2 if transition occured on Bbar,3 if transition occured on both
 IFMIX :0 if no mixing ocured, 1 if mixing occured on original B,
        2 if mixing occured on original Bbar,3 if mixing occured on both
 IGRAPH :only relevant for BREM5:1 to 5 ,0 for LUND
 
   Weight :can be ignored if all events have weight 1 (unweighted option)
           otherwise, as generated by BREM5

6. comments   :
 
   Note that in the example data cards file , the cards to modify the
 fragmentation functions for c and b flavors are included( see reference
 ALEPH note 88-82 by S.Dugeay and P.Henrard), even if they are set by
 default in the code.
 
   In the exec ( command file) one should add the extra generator as
 requested , that is BREM02 (or BREM03) if BREM5 required, DYMU02 if
 DYMU3 required.
 
   One should also use the modified LUND routines to benefit from updated
 tau decays and correct Dalitz decay of pi0's ( link with LUNMOD file by
 answering Yes to the question asked by the exec )
 
   Starting from version 1.05 a new bank KZFR is added for each event.It
 contains the z value which is used at fragmentation time for heavy particles.
 It is also transmitted to decay products of heavy particles as long as they
 carry also heavy flavor or are charged leptons.This bank KZFR is later in
 the programs chain transformed into FZFR which carry similar info parallel to
 FKIN bank.

2. write-up   : EPOCS ( Electron POsitron Collision Simulator) is a Monte
  Carlo event generator for high energy e+e- annihilation in the energy
  region of TRISTAN, SLC and LEP.
  EPOCS generates events through a two stage procedure :
  -First it generates partons according to perturbative QCD and electro-
  weak theory.If the beam energy is appropriate ,it may generate a
  quarkonium state.
  -Second, partons (quarks and gluons) are converted into hadrons through
  an Hadronization model.Unstable hadrons are subsequently decayed.
  As very little is known on heavy flavor particle decays, such particles
  are decayed into a few partons following perturbative calculations and
  then the resulting partons are hadronized.
 
  More information on the program can be found in the user's manual

2. write-up   :
 The HERWIG Monte-Carlo program can be used for the simulation of the
process :
                  e+  e-  -----> hadrons
The fragmentation of the partons into hadrons is done by a cluster algo-
rithm.Any information about HERWIG itself can be found in the ref.
In the present HERWIG version 3.0, no radiative corrections have been
included yet.
The HERWIG code in general is untouched except for a very few changes:
  - There was a potential clash with the GHEISHA program due to the
COMMON /EVENT/.
This COMMON has been renamed in HERWIG to COMMON /XVENT/.
 - The width of the Z0 was given in a data statement in subroutine
UTEEQQ (variable named DMZ). This variable has been added to common
/PARAM/ and is now initialized in SUBROUTINE INIWIG.
 -  An error patch, sent by Bryan Webber,has been applied to the code.

2. write-up   :
The HERWIG (Hadron Emission Reactions With Interfering Gluons)Monte-Carlo
event generator was written by G. Marchesini and B.R. Webber.
HERWIG can be used for the simulation of the process :
                  e+  e-  -----> hadrons
This process is split up into several subprocesses.
First, a hard process
                  e+  e-  -----> qqbar
is simulated. At present in HERWIG this is done using only the Born cross
-section. In the interface to KINGAL one has the possibility to switch to LUND
(including weak effects), with and without first order QED-Bremsstrahlung. An
option to select a special type of quarks is provided for all cases.
 
The partons from the hard subprocess are evolved with a parton shower algorithm.
 It contains the following features:
  - QCD jet evolution with soft gluon interference via angular ordering
  - Azimuthal correlations within and between jets due to interference
  - Azimuthal correlations within jets due to gluon polarization
Gluons are always split into a quark-antiquark pair.
 
The fragmentation of the partons into hadrons is done by a cluster algorithm.
Always two partons form a colour-singlet cluster. The hadrons are produced
through two-body isotropic decays of the clusters.The hadrons are chosen
according to the density of states. The larger the mass of a certain state
is the smaller is the probability to generate it (smaller phase space factor).
Therefore the spectrum of hadrons is controlled by the mass scale of the
clusters.
The following parameters can be used to influence the mass scale:
  - QCDLAM (Lambda-QCD, default value 0.2 GeV): A lower value of
    QCDLAM would give less clusters and more massive ones.
  - RMASS(13) (gluon virtual mass cut-off, default value 0.65 GeV)
  - QKEFM (effective mass of light quark pairs after non-perturbative
    gluon splitting, default value 0.32 GeV)
If the squared invariant mass of a cluster is larger than the maximum-cluster-
mass-parameter (CLMAX) plus the squared sum of the parton masses, the parent
cluster is chopped into two clusters.
 
Finally, unstable particles as well as heavy flavours will be decayed. In the
latter case the parton shower algorithm will be applied again, i.e. heavy
flavour decays are treated as new hard processes.
 
The program has not been tuned to data yet.
 
More information about HERWIG itself can be found in the references.

             KS*1000000 + IMOTH2*1000 + IMOTH1.
where KS is the HERWIG status code, IMOTH1 and IMOTH2 denote the entries
of the 'mothers' of the particle.
For 'normal' particles IMOTH2 = 0. Particles which appear several times
in the HERWIG event listing only have one entry in this 'KHIS' bank.
 
6.3 The original version of HERWIG 3.4 uses the random number generator RAN on
 the VAX. The entire version uses RANMAR.Thus the random number seed eventually
 printed by HERWIG is always the original seed supplied by the user with the
 data card RMAR.
 
6.4 The particle masses are always taken from the ALEPH particle table as long
as they are available. Note, that the masses of the top-mesons, top-baryons and
the diquarks are computed in HERWIG by simply adding the quarks masses(neglect-
ing any binding energy).In general the forming of the clusters requires that the
sum of the masses of two quarks is greater than the mass of lowest hadron formed
by the two quarks. Otherwise events will be rejected sometimes.
This problem might be solved in the next version of HERWIG.

0. platforms : IBM ALWS AXP/VMS
   additionnal code needed : JETSET73 library ( block data LUDATA)
               Better use a later version
 
1. code I.D.  : original version JETSET 7.3 from Sjostrand disk 192
                taken from this disk October  16 ,1990
                interfaced from August to October 1990 by B.Bloch
                with substantial contributions from T.Medcalf and O.Boyle
                contact people : B. Bloch-Devaux,T.Medcalf,O.Boyle.
 
2. write-up   :
  The write-up of the program can be found :
    IBM : gime TORSJO 192 , then JETSET73 MANUAL on that disk
    VAX : KIN:JETSET73.MANUAL
 This is a temporary solution as the 7.3 version is still evolving.
 Once it is release officially documentation will be available from CERN Library
 
 From the user point of view, the generator has been interfaced in the same
way as LUND02:The user can choose to have mixing or not, and if so the mixing
parameters are considered separatly for Bd and Bs.
 The time dependance of the mixing probability is taken into account
together with the decay probability.
 For completeness, CP violation effects in DeltaB=+-2 are also included.
 However, these effects are small compared to CP violation effects in
B-decays.In that later case, B decays into a CP eigenstate.
 One can recognize later that mixing occured by looking at the mother of
the considered meson : in case of mixing ,the mother is also a B (B bar)
meson.
 2.1 Mixing : The parameters involved are xq , yq , where q refers to
   d or s flavor.
     xq = DeltaM/Gamma         , yq = DeltaGamma/2*Gamma
    The propability of mixing is then : (xq**2+yq**2)/2.*(1.+xq**2)
 
 2.2 Mixing and CP violation : the module and the phase enter here and
     modify the probability which becomes then different for B and Bbar
 
 2.3 CP violation in |Delta B|=1 decays:This look promising for final
     states which are CP eigenstates.The time evolution of B0 and B0bar
     are affected differently.

5. header informations :
 5.1 run header
   One parameter bank KPAR is created and data cards used as explained
above are also kept as BOS Banks at the beginning of the file. So it is
highly recommended to make use of this facility to modify default values
of the Lund parameters.
   Parameter bank 'KPAR' contains 18 or more real*4 values corresponding
   to :
     TABL(1) =IFL                         TABL(2) = ECMS
     TABL(3) =smearing of x_vertex        TABL(4) = smearing of y_vertex
     TABL(5) =smearing of z_vertex        TABL(6) = Xd
     TABL(7) =Yd                          TABL(8) = Xs
     TABL(9) =Ys                          TABL(10)= PMOD
     TABL(11)=PHAD                        TABL(12)= PMOS
     TABL(13)=PHAS                        TABL(14)= CDCPB(Bd-->Bdbar)
     TABL(15)=CDCPBA(Bdbar-->Bd)          TABL(16)= CSCPB(Bs-->Bsbar)
     TABL(16)=CSCPBA(Bsbar-->Bs)          TABL(18)= NPAR
    If NPAR is positive then
     TABL(19:18+NPAR)= ICODP(1:NPAR)      TABL(18+NPAR+1)=PMO
     TABL(18+NPAR+2) = PHA
 
   Integer values are stored as real; SVRT corresponds to the smearing of
the vertex position (in cm).
 
   CDCPBA,CDCPB,CSCPBA,CSCPB are the resulting probabilities for the
four processes :  Bd bar-->Bd , Bd --> Bd bar
         and      Bs bar-->Bs , Bs --> Bs bar
 
 5.2 event header
   Process identifier IDPR = Flavor code of the generated event(1 digit
per qqbar flavor ).
In case of mixed flavor run, the event is analysed to give in this word
the flavor generated (the second flavor generated in the event appears
as the lowest decimal digit, that is 21 means ddbar quarks plus a uubar
pair).
 
   Weight :can be ignored as all events have weight 1.
 
   Center of mass energy ECMS = as defined by the user in the Data card.

    5012 - HVFL02 /HVFL03  ( code 5021)
    **********************
 
0. platforms : IBM ALWS AXP/VMS
   additionnal code needed : JETSET73 library ( block data LUDATA)
               Better use a later version
 
1. code I.D.  : HEAVY FLAVOR group Monte-Carlo built for its own needs
               interfaced from December 1990 to February 1991.JETSET7.3 version
               contact people : B.Bloch-Devaux & Alain Falvard.
 
2. write-up   :
  HVFL02 uses JETSET 7.3 framework.For general description of the  program,
the reader should look at the specific documentation  given as JETSET73
manual ( IBM TORSJO 192 disk or KIN:JETSET73.MANUAL on Vax)
  HVFL02 name was used up to version 1.02 , then following versions were named
as HVFL03 to help production book-keeping.
  As a consequence , the JETSET 7.3 convention for quark numbering scheme is
used throughout the whole program : d quark is #1 , u quark is #2 ,then as usual
s quark is #3 , c quark is #4 , b quark is #5 and top is #6...
  The idea of such a generator is to be able to build easily new features
specific to the Heavy Flavor Physics.
   The following options are provided:
  2.1 Choose qqbar generator:LUND7.3 is option 1  including definition
of Flavor to be generated , Energy in C.M., Z0,TOP , HIGGs masses ...
A Z0 is stored after initial state photon (if any) and before shower
evolution if MSTJ(115)=3
                            BREM5 is option 2  with same facilities
                            DYMU3 is option 3  with same facilities
Final State Radiation is handled within Parton shower , so in case
BREM5 or DYMU3 are selected, FSR generation from the producer is disabled
and activated in the Parton Shower to which the original q qbar pair is
interfaced.The last two options give the possibility to generate weigthed
or unweighted events.
  2.2 A debugging option exists producing single particle with flavor and
kinematics as specified in GSIN card
  2.3 Include Mixing and CP violation effects for B and Bbar mesons,as
described in HVFL01 documentation and references therein.
  2.4 Include implementation of Vbu transitions in addition to 'standard'
Vbc transitions with choice between several models.
  Note that only B-mesons are affected by the GVBU card , not B-Baryons
 which are still under JETSET 7.3 full control.( it includes some b->u decays)
  2.5 Include Heavy Flavor group agreement on D's decay modes and branching
 fractions.
Many more exclusive channels have been defined compared to JETSET 6.3 version .
  2.6 Introduce radiative leptonic decay of Psi ( as provided by John Drinkard)
the code of LUDECY for Psi has been modified and deacys into e+e-gamma and
mu+mu-gamma are added.
  2.7 B-mesons and baryons:A distinction has been introduced  between B-mesons
  and B-baryons which was not implemented in JETSET7.3
B-mesons have now KF code 100 ( instead of 85) and their decay table reproduces
what we have modified :
           -2-body exclusive decays
           -3-body baryonic decays
           -semi-leptonic D* pi and D** decays
           -spectator diagrams decays
B-Baryons have KF code 85 and use the JETSET 7.3 decay tables defined with
spectator diagrams(including some b-->u).
Specific Baryons decays can be modified explicitely using GRPL,GADM,GMOB cards
  ( see example for Lambda_b in the cards)
More specific decays including polarization can be obtained for semi-leptonic
decays of Lambda_b into Lambda lepton neutrino through the GLMB card( to be
implemented....)
  Activate the print flag in GHVF card to obtain a full listing of decay tables.
  2.8 Include possibility of choosing between different models for B
semi-leptonic decays , including some hypothesis on production of different
types of D** particles ( GSEM and GDSS cards).
  2.9 Include possibility of choosing between different decay scheme for first
and second B meson through GDC1,GDC2 cards
  2.10 Possibility of using RANMAR random numbers generator instead of RNDM
  2.11 Starting with version 1.03 ( known as first HVFL03 version ) a new option
was introduced to handle radiative semi-leptonic decays of b and c hadrons via
the GPHO card.To help production book keeping , a different code ( 5021) was
introduced for HVFL03 , even if no drastic change was  made.

6. comments   :
 
  Fragmentation z information is kept in KZFR bank. Mother's z is
transmitted all the way down the decay chain particles.KZFR is tranlated
into FZFR when KINE is translated to FKIN bank.
   Psi' with KF code 440 has been added to the list of JETSET particles
 with our usual decay modes.
   LUDECY has been modified to
          - handle the Psi'--> Psi pi pi amplitude
          - handle B-mesons decays:
          .  give the right relative fraction of Psi,Psi',Etac
          .  handle pi D* and D**(named D*_2)semi-leptonic decays
          .  handle 3-body baryonic decays
          .  reject 2-body decays of B-mesons produced through diagrams
          if already defined exclusively
 
In the exec (command file) one should remember to specify link to JETSET 7.3  .
In principle , if one uses the standard KINRUN on IBM  or 'KINRUN HVFL02 'on
Vax  , it gets loaded automatically.
   The modified code of JETSET73 is maintained as JETSET7B in KINGAL.
 When using option 2 or 3 of GHVF card , do not forget to specify
that BREM03 ( DYMU02) additionnal libraries are needed.
 When using option LARGER than 10 , load in addition the ARIA01 Library !
   If a GPHO card is used , the library PHOTOS ( or ALPHOTOS on KIN to use
 the latest version 1.06 ) must be loaded too.
 
  Running HVFL02 under above conditions gives the following harmless

               Better use a later version
 
1. code I.D.  : original version HERWIG 5.0 from B. Webber.
                transmitted in January   1991 by E. Lange (MPI-Munich)
                interfaced in  1990 by E. Lange.
                contact people : E.Lange and B.Bloch.
 
2. write-up   :
  The HERWIG (Hadron Emission Reactions With Interfering Gluons)Monte-Carlo
   event generator was written by G. Marchesini and B.R. Webber.
  HERWIG can be used for the simulation of the process :
                  e+  e-  -----> hadrons
  This process is split up into several subprocesses.
  First, a hard process
                  e+  e-  -----> qqbar
  is simulated. At present in HERWIG this is done using only the Born cross-
  section. In the interface to KINGAL one has the possibility to switch to LUND
  (including weak effects), with and without first order QED-Bremsstrahlung.
  Compared to previous versions , HRWG05 version 5.0 includes Deep Inelastic
  Scattering and Heavy Flavour Electroproduction by C G.Abbiendi and L.Stanco,
  Dipartimento di Fisica, Universita di Padova
   An option to select a special type of quarks is provided for all cases.
 
  The partons from the hard subprocess are evolved with a parton shower
   algorithm. It contains the following features:
  - QCD jet evolution with soft gluon interference via angular ordering
  - Azimuthal correlations within and between jets due to interference
  - Azimuthal correlations within jets due to gluon polarization
  Gluons are always split into a quark-antiquark pair.
 
  The fragmentation of the partons into hadrons is done by a cluster algorithm.
  Always two partons form a colour-singlet cluster. The hadrons are produced
  through two-body isotropic decays of the clusters.The hadrons are chosen
  according to the density of states. The larger the mass of a certain state
  is the smaller is the probability to generate it (smaller phase space factor).
   Therefore the spectrum of hadrons is controlled by the mass scale of the
   clusters.
  The following parameters can be used to influence the mass scale:
  - QCDLAM (Lambda-QCD, default value 0.2 GeV): A lower value of
    QCDLAM would give less clusters and more massive ones.
  - RMASS(13) (gluon virtual mass cut-off, default value 0.65 GeV)
  - QKEFM (effective mass of light quark pairs after non-perturbative gluon
    splitting, default value 0.32 GeV)
  If the squared invariant mass of a cluster is larger than the maximum-cluster-
  mass-parameter (CLMAX) plus the squared sum of the parton masses, the parent
  cluster is chopped into two clusters.
 
  Finally, unstable particles as well as heavy flavours will be decayed. In the
  latter case the parton shower algorithm will be applied again, i.e. heavy
  flavour decays are treated as new hard processes.
 
  The program has not been tuned to data yet.
 
  More information about HERWIG itself can be found in the references.

6. comments   :
 
 6.1 If the user wants to change any other parameter within HERWIG, he
can do this in the user initialization routine USTART .
 
 6.2 The HERWIG event listing contains some 'objects' which are not
particles (jet cones etc.), they are just skipped when filling KINE banks.
The beam electrons are stored in KINE banks (negative number) as usual.
The exchanged vector boson Z0/gamma is linked to the primary vertex as
well as a possible radiative photon.
In the HERWIG event listing the same particle may appear several times
(with different status codes). It only will be stored once in the BOS banks.
Note, that the KHIS bank information is not compatible with the LUND History
code.Especially,for cluster fragmentation,a 'daughter' can have several mothers.
The entries in 'KHIS' look like
             KS*1000000 + IMOTH2*1000 + IMOTH1.
where KS is the HERWIG status code, IMOTH1 and IMOTH2 denote the entries of
the 'mothers' of the particle.
For 'normal' particles IMOTH2 = 0. Particles which appear several times
in the HERWIG event listing only have one entry in this 'KHIS' bank.
 
6.3 The original version of HERWIG 3.4 uses the random number generator RAN on
the VAX. The entire version uses RANMAR. Thus the random number seed eventually
printed by HERWIG is always the original seed supplied by the user with the data
card RMAR.
 
6.4 The particle masses are always taken from the ALEPH particle table as
long as they are available. Note, that the masses of the top-mesons, top-
baryons and the diquarks are computed in HERWIG by simply adding the quarks
masses (neglecting any binding energy).
In general the forming of the clusters requires that the sum of the masses
of two quarks is greater than the mass of lowest hadron formed by the two
quarks. Otherwise events will be rejected sometimes.
This problem might be solved in the next version of HERWIG.
 
6.5 Two intermediate versions of HERWIG ( versions 4.1 and 4.3 ) were also
interfaced by E. Lange in 1990 and used privatly by some users  under the names
HRWG03 and HRWG04 respectively.The above two versions were never released offi-
cially on the KIN disk.The latest HRWG05 verion 5.0 should be used.

2. write-up   :
   ARIADNE3 is a Monte Carlo program for generating QCD cascades, based on the
 colour dipole approximation . The program is an extension of the program
 ARIADNE 2, including gluon splitting in the colour dipole formulation of QCD.
   The perturbative QCD cascade can be formulated in two complementary ways,
 either in terms of quarks and gluons or in terms of colour dipoles (colour
 antennae).
 It has been shown that when a gluon is emitted from one dipole (e.g. from an
 quark-antiquark pair produced in e+e- annihilation)the subsequent emission of
 a softer gluon is given by two independent dipoles , one stretched from the
 quark to the gluon and the other from the gluon to the antiquark. There is
 also a correction term with the relative magnitude (1/N_c)^2 corresponding
 to radiation between the quark and the antiquark, which is neglected here.
   We generalize this result so that the emission of one more gluon is given
 by three independent dipoles etc. These dipoles then form links in a chain,
 such that one gluon connects two dipoles and one dipole connects two partons.
 The gluons are ordered in the dipole chain according to their colour. This is
 in close correspondance with the Lund string model , where gluons acts  as
 transverse exitations (kinks) on a stringlike field. The breaking of a dipole
 into two dipoles thus corresponds to one more kink on the string.
 
   A previous paper presents the Monte Carlo program ARIADNE 2 which generates
 QCD cascades according to the colour dipole formulation.This program can be
 used for generating cascades not only in e+e- annihilation (which is be handled
 already by the first program ARIADNE)but also in lepto production and hadro
 production.
 
 These previous programs dealt only with gluon emission. In a QCD cascade there
 is however also the possibility that a gluon is split into a quark - antiquark
 pair. To implement this into the colour dipole cascade picture is, however, not
 trivial. The program presented here is an update of ARIADNE2 in which the gluon
 splitting has been implemented according to the model described briefly below
 and more extensively in ref. 3.6.
 There are three subversions of the program :ARIADNE3.0 and ARIADNE3.1.,3.3
 Versions 3.0 and 3.1 are essentially identical,the only difference being that
 while version 3.0is intended to be used together with the program JETSET 6.3 .
 version 3.1 is adapted to the particle codes and the new event record format of
 JETSET 7.3 . Both are written entirely in FORTRAN 77.
  Version 3.3 beta have final state radiation included with possibly several
 photons emitted.

6. comments   :
   This is still a preliminary version, which , contrary to KINGAL usage,
 will not store primary beams,Z0 and original q qbar even if asked for!!!
   This has to be fixed with author collaboration as this would perturbed
 ARIADNE running....All photons emitted ( ISR as well as FSR ) appear with
 mother 0.ISR photons appear before the partons of the string, FSR photon(s)
 just after.Remember to specify that you need to link with JETSET 7.3 when using
 KINRUN.

2. write-up   :
PYTHIA is a program intended for the study of hadronic processes.
Historically, this has meant incoming hadron, but today also lepton
beams are included, so that e.g. e+e- and ep events can be generated,
in addition to pp ones. (Further combinations, involving antiprotons,
neutrons, pions, photons, muons, etc., are also possible.) For
completeness, it is also possible to generate a few non-hadronic
final states. In hadronic interactions, the emphasis is on high-pT
physics, but PYTHIA also covers the domain of low-pT interactions
as an integral part of the total cross-section. In its present form it
includes hard scattering matrix elements, structure functions and
initial and final state parton showers. Fragmentation is performed using
the ordinary Lund fragmentation model, JETSET version 7.3, but an
important task for PYTHIA is to set up the correct string configuration,
particularly nontrivial for the low-pT target remnants.
  The present version is interfaced assuming LEP operation , that is
electron-positron beams within the Aleph Reference system convention.

  The present version is interfaced assuming LEP operation , that is

The updates from version 5.5 to 5.6 are all minor, and just about any program
that ran with version 5.5 will also work with PYTHIA 5.6.
The following changes might give compatibility problems from programs
based on PYTHIA 5.5:
- Structure functions have been reorganized, such that the user interface
  PYSTFE has been replaced by in-code interfaces to the PDFLIB , PAKPDF
  and PHOPDF structure function packages. To enable the appropriate
  interfaces,look for lines with C! in the first two columns of the
  FORTRAN source file.
  Also, the MSTP(51) - MSTP(58) switches for structure functions have
  been changed.
 
In addition, the following changes have been made, where no
compatibility problems are involved:
- Addition of a routine PYEVWT to allow users to modify cross-sections
  and weight events; see section 2.1.
- QCD shower evolution for photon inside electron. Intrinsic k_T
  in photon; see MSTP(93).
- Additional scale choices are possible for Deep Inelastic Scattering
  processes; see MSTP(22) and MSTP(32).
 At the interface level , some more sets of subprocesses have been defined
 for Gamma-gamma physics.

0. platforms : IBM ALWS AXP/VMS  better use a later version
   additionnal code needed : DYMU02
 
1. code I.D.  : original version HERWIG 5.4 from B. Webber.
                transmitted in February 1992 by A.S.Thompson (Glasgow)
                interfaced in 1992 by A.S.Thompson using code
                written by E.Lange for previous HERWIG versions.
                contact people : A.S.THOMPSON ( AST@CERNVM)
 
2. write-up   :
  The HERWIG (Hadron Emission Reactions With Interfering Gluons)Monte-Carlo
   event generator was written by G. Marchesini and B.R. Webber. It is
   designed to simulate high energy hadronic processes with particular
   emphasis on QCD parton showers.
  It contains,among others, the following features:
  - QCD jet evolution with soft gluon interference via angular ordering
  - Azimuthal correlations within and between jets due to interference
  - Azimuthal correlations within jets due to gluon polarization
  - Cluster hadronization of jets via non-perturbative gluon splitting.
 
  With respect to version 5.0 the following new features have been added
  - A correction to hard gluon emission to add events in the regin of
    phase space corresponding to a q-qbar pair recoiling from a very hard
    gluon
  - Photons are now included in time-like parton showering with a
    corresponding correction to that above applied.
  - A new parameter B1LIM has been introduced to control B cluster
    hadronization.
  - B decays can additionally be performed by the EURODEC or CLEO Monte
    Carlo packages.
 
  The following parameters can be used to tune to the data (done by
  Gerald Rudolph 28.9.92)
  - QCDLAM (Lambda-QCD, default value 0.18 GeV): Can be identified
    with Lambda-MSbar but only at high momentum fractions (x or z).
  - RMASS(13) (effective gluon mass, default value 0.75 GeV)
  - CLMAX maximum allowed mass of a cluster made from 2 quarks (default
    value 3.35)
  - VQCUT a cutoff added to quark masses in the parton showers to avoid
    divergences (default 0.48)
  - VGCUT as above added to gluon masses (default 0.10)
  - VPCUT the analogous quantity for photon emission, the default is
    root(s) - no emission; data indicate it is insensitive to its exact
    value in the range 0.1-1.0 .
 
  An interface to DYMU3 has been added to provide the initial process
  including initial state radiation but not final state. Electroweak
  parameters are taken from the HERWIG values. To use this option ,
  set the IHARD parameter on the GHRW card to 3.
 
  Routines from Glen Cowan have been incorporated to save and restore
  the partons coming from the parton shower. To indicate which should
  be used for parton level calculations, the last in the shower has
  a second mother, this mother being the first parton in the shower.
 
  More information about HERWIG itself can be found in the references, in
   particular ref 3.5 describes version 5.4 .

  To overwrite values of the HERWIG common variables one may use some
keyword in the following way :
* data card GMAS for redefinition of particle masses
* IPART - HERWIG particle code
* XMAS - mass value defined by user
*
* GMAS IPART / XMAS   will set RMASS(IPART) = XMAS
* some examples:

GMAS  13 / .801  sets gluon effective mass (Default = 0.75)
*                TUNED VALUE = 0.801 (GERALD RUDOLPH 28.9.92)
* GMAS  198 /  80.77
* GMAS  199 /  80.77    sets W+ W- masses to 80.77 GeV
GMAS  200 /  91.17    sets Z0 mass to 91.17 GeV
* GMAS  201  / 100.     sets Higgs mass to 100. GeV
 
* data card GSTA to set particles stable/unstable
* IPART - HERWIG particle code
*
* GSTA  IPART / 'OFF' will set particle IPART stable  : decay is OFF
* GSTA  IPART / 'ON'  will set particle IPART unstable: decay is ON
* example:
* GSTA    21 / 'OFF'  would make pi0 stable inside HERWIG

6. comments   :
 
 6.1 If the user wants to change any other parameter within HERWIG, he
can do this in the user initialization routine USTART .
 
 6.2 The HERWIG event listing contains some 'objects' which are not
particles (jet cones etc.), they are just skipped when filling KINE banks.
The beam electrons are stored in KINE banks (negative number) as usual.
The exchanged vector boson Z0/gamma is linked to the primary vertex as
well as a possible initial state radiative photon. Final state radiated
photons link to their parent quark and appear as the first particle
after the clusters.
In the HERWIG event listing the same particle may appear several times
(with different status codes). It only will be stored once in the BOS banks.
Note, that the KHIS bank information is not compatible with the LUND History
code.Especially,for cluster fragmentation,a 'daughter' can have several mothers.
The entries in 'KHIS' look like
             KS*1000000 + IMOTH2*1000 + IMOTH1.
where KS is the HERWIG status code, IMOTH1 and IMOTH2 denote the entries of
the 'mothers' of the particle.
For 'normal' particles IMOTH2 = 0. Particles which appear several times
in the HERWIG event listing only have one entry in this 'KHIS' bank.
 
6.3 The original version of HERWIG 5.4 uses an explicitly written version
of RANMAR. This has been changed to use the KINGAL version so the seed as
supplied by the RMAR card is always used.
 
6.4 The particle masses are always taken from the ALEPH particle table as
long as they are available. Note, that the masses of the top-mesons, top-
baryons and the diquarks are computed in HERWIG by simply adding the quarks
masses (neglecting any binding energy).
In general the forming of the clusters requires that the sum of the masses
of two quarks is greater than the mass of lowest hadron formed by the two
quarks. Otherwise events will be rejected sometimes.
This problem might be solved in the next version of HERWIG.
 
6.5 If using option 3 for IHARD don't forget to link with DYMU02 library !!

2. write-up   :
  The major changes from previous versions are the introduction of photon
radiation from quarks ..
  The Colour Dipole Model (CDM) as implemented in the Ariadne program has had
considerable success in describing data from both e+e- and lepto-production
experiments.
  The CDM differs from other QCD cascade models in that it in a natural way
correctly treats most QCD coherence effects by describing the gluon brems-
strahlung in terms of radiation from colour dipoles between partons, instead
 of treating partons as independent emitters.
  The CDM is based on the fact that a gluon emitted from a qqbar pair in an
e+e- collision can be treated as radiation from the colour dipole between the
q and qbar, and that to a good approximation, the emission of a second softer
gluon can be treated as radiation from two independent dipoles, one between the
quark and gluon and one between the gluon and qbar.
  In the CDM this is generalized so that the emission of a third, still softer
gluon, is given by three independent dipoles etc.
  Ariadne only generates the QCD cascade process and is interfaced to other
programs which handles hard interactions, hadronization and particle decays.
Standard interfaces to the JETSET ,LEPTO and PYTHIA programs are included in
from versions 4.01 onwards.
  The first version of Ariadne only handled gluon radiation from primary quarks
in e+e- collisions. Since then the program has evolved as follows
ariadne2 : Included gluon emission from extended emitters to describe the QCD
showers in lepto-production.
ariadne3 : Included also production of qqbar pairs from gluon splitting.
 version 3.1: Adopted the new event record of JETSET version 7.1.
 version 3.2: Included preliminary facilities for generating  dipole
  showers in hadron-hadron collisions.
 version 3.3: Included a preliminary treatment of electro-magnetic dipole
  radiation of photons.
 version 4.01:Completely rewritten, built around a new internal dipole
  oriented event record. The preliminary features of sub-versions 3.2 and
  3.3 are properly included.
  Streamlined interfaces to the JETSET, LEPTO and PYTHIA are introduced
  as well as a new jet clustering routine, inspired by the CDM.
 version 4.02: Fixed bugs in connection with phase space restrictions
  (in 4.01 the switch MSTA(11) was inactive and effectively set to 4).
  Also a bug related to the option MSTA(20) = 2, and to the quark masses
  and charges in QED emissions was fixed.
 version 4.03: Added options for emissions from extended
  dipoles (see description of MSTA(18),  MSTA(25) and PARA(25)).
  Also introduced two new sets of tuned parameters ( 'ALEPH' and 'EMC)
  in subroutine ARTUNE. Please note that, in connection with this, a few
  parameters and switches were given new default values. Note
  especially that the default is to automatically call ARTUNE('EMC)' in
  subroutine ARINIT, hence the switch MSTA(3) must be set to 0 before
  the call to ARINIT if the user wants to modify any parameters or
  switches.
  In previous releases, increased precision could be obtained by
  removing the comment of an implicit double precision statement. From
  this release on, increased precision will be the default
 version 4.04: Fixed minor bug in ARCLUS and speeded up the clustering
  algorithm. Added minor features to ARCLUS to make it more compatible
  with the LUCLUS routine.

5. header informations :
 5.1 run header
   Parameter bank 'KPAR' contains 6 real*4 values corresponding to :
  IFL, ECMS,IPROC,SVRT(1:3).
   Integer values are stored as real; SVRT corresponds to the smearing of
the vertex position (in cm).
 
 5.2 event header
   Process identifier IDPR = Flavor code of the generated event(1 digit
per qqbar flavor ).
In case of mixed flavor run, the event is analysed to give in this word
the flavor generated (the second flavor generated in the event appears
as the lowest decimal digit, that is 21 means ddbar quarks plus a uubar
pair).
 
   Weight :can be ignored as all events have weight 1.
 
   Center of mass energy ECMS = as defined by the user in the Data card.
 
6. comments   :  The complete tuning of this generator to Aleph data is not
yet available.Fragmentation parameters may change from the values used in
the standard JETSET 7.3 option.

1. code I.D.  : original version HERWIG 5.6 from B. Webber.
                Transmitted in March 1993,
                interfaced in 1993 by A.S.Thompson using code
                written by E.Lange for previous HERWIG versions.
                contact people : E.Lange and B.Bloch.
                Modifed version of routine HWCHAD available from
                B.Webber for anisotropic cluster decay. (see below)
 
2. write-up   :
  The HERWIG (Hadron Emission Reactions With Interfering Gluons)Monte-Carlo
   event generator was written by G. Marchesini and B.R. Webber. It is
   designed to simulate high energy hadronic processes with particular
   emphasis on QCD parton showers.
  It contains,among others, the following features:
  - QCD jet evolution with soft gluon interference via angular ordering
  - Azimuthal correlations within and between jets due to interference
  - Azimuthal correlations within jets due to gluon polarization
  - Cluster hadronization of jets via non-perturbative gluon splitting.
 
  With respect to version 5.0 the following new features have been added
  - A correction to hard gluon emission to add events in the regin of
    phase space corresponding to a q-qbar pair recoiling from a very hard
    gluon
  - Photons are now included in time-like parton showering with a
    corresponding correction to that above applied.
  - A new parameter B1LIM has been introduced to control B cluster
    hadronization.
  - B decays can additionally be performed by the EURODEC or CLEO Monte
    Carlo packages.
 
  Versions 5.5/5.6 include the following new features
  - Alpha-em is multiplied by a factor ALPFAC to improve efficiency
    of photon FSR studies. ALPFAC should not be set greater than 5.
  - the variable SUDORD is introduced to control the calculation
    of the Sudakov form factors. This should have little effect in
    this version, but be significant in the future.
  - CLPOW is included in the condition to control the decay of heavy
    clusters. This was previously fixed at 2. and lower values increase
    the yield of heavier clusters and hence of baryons for heavy quarks.
  - The entries for partons before hadronization are retained. To
    distinguish these partons from those arising from gluon splitting
    a second mother (actually the grandmother) has been included
    in the output.
  - The maximum number of outgoing partons in a hard subprocess is now
    set at 200
 
  The following parameters can be used to tune to the data (done by
  Gerald Rudolph 28.9.92)
  - QCDLAM (Lambda-QCD, default value 0.18 GeV): Can be identified
    with Lambda-MSbar but only at high momentum fractions (x or z).
  - RMASS(13) (effective gluon mass, default value 0.75 GeV)
  - CLMAX maximum allowed mass of a cluster made from 2 quarks (default
    value 3.35)
  - VQCUT a cutoff added to quark masses in the parton showers to avoid
    divergences (default 0.48)
  - VGCUT as above added to gluon masses (default 0.10)
  - VPCUT the analogous quantity for photon emission, the default is
    root(s) - no emission; data indicate it is insensitive to its exact
    value in the range 0.1-1.0 .
 
  An interface to DYMU3 has been added to provide the initial process
  including initial state radiation but not final state. Electroweak
  parameters are taken from the HERWIG values. To use set the IHARD
  parameter on the GENE card to 3.
 
  A modified version of the cluster decay routine HWCHAD is available
  and can be linked in if required. Clusters are decayed isotropically
  in their centre of mass frame, the modified version produces
  anisotropic decay where one quark in the cluster has been produced
  in the parton shower by producing the fragments of the quark in the
  direction of the incoming quark. Thus a strange meson decayed from
  a cluster from an s-quark would have a harder momentum spectrum
  than previously.
 
  More information about HERWIG itself can be found in the references, in
   particular ref 3.5 describes version 5.4 .

* GSTA 60 / 'ON'    ! K0S     makes K0s decay inside HERWIG
* GSTA 78 / 'ON'    !LAMBDA
* GSTA 86 / 'ON'    !SIGMA+
* GSTA 81 / 'ON'    !SIGMA-
* GSTA 88 / 'ON'    !XI 0
* GSTA 83 / 'ON'    !XI -
* GSTA 90 / 'ON'    !OMEGA -
* GSTA 96 / 'ON'    !ANTI LAMBDA
* GSTA 104 / 'ON'   !ANTI SIGMA -
* GSTA 99 / 'ON'    !ANTI SIGMA +
* GSTA 106 / 'ON'   !ANTI XI 0
* GSTA 101 / 'ON'   !ANTI XI +
* GSTA 108 / 'ON'   !ANTI OMEGA +
 It may seem easier to use a data card KTMX to handle the stability of
particles at generator level :   KTMX   ct0
will allow decay at generator level of all particles with a proper lifetime
less than ct0 seconds.

 6.1 If the user wants to change any other parameter within HERWIG, he
can do this in the user initialization routine USTART .
 
 6.2 The HERWIG event listing contains some 'objects' which are not
particles (jet cones etc.), they are just skipped when filling KINE banks.
The beam electrons are stored in KINE banks (negative number) as usual.
The exchanged vector boson Z0/gamma is linked to the primary vertex as
well as a possible initial state radiative photon. Final state radiated
photons link to their parent quark and appear among the partons before
hadronization.
In the HERWIG event listing the same particle may appear several times
(with different status codes). It only will be stored once in the BOS
banks.
Note, that the KHIS bank information is not compatible with the LUND
History code. For cluster fragmentation and to indicate partons before
hadronization a 'daughter' can have two mothers.
The entries in 'KHIS' look like
             KS*1000000 + IMOTH2*1000 + IMOTH1.
where KS is the HERWIG status code, IMOTH1 and IMOTH2 denote the entries
of the 'mothers' of the particle.
For 'normal' particles IMOTH2 = 0. Particles which appear several times
in the HERWIG event listing only have one entry in this 'KHIS' bank.
 
6.3 The original version of HERWIG 5.5 uses an explicitly written version
of RANMAR. This has been changed to use the KINGAL version so the seed as
supplied by the RMAR card is always used.
 
6.4 The particle masses are always taken from the ALEPH particle table as
long as they are available. Note, that the masses of the top-mesons, top-
baryons and the diquarks are computed in HERWIG by simply adding the quarks
masses (neglecting any binding energy).

1. code I.D.  : original version HERWIG 5.7 from B. Webber et al.
                Transmitted in November 1993,
                interfaced in 1993 by A.S.Thompson using code
                written by E.Lange for previous HERWIG versions.
                contact people : A.S.Thompson and B.Bloch.
 
2. write-up   :
  The HERWIG (Hadron Emission Reactions With Interfering Gluons)Monte-Carlo
   event generator was written by G. Marchesini and B.R. Webber. It is
   designed to simulate high energy hadronic processes with particular
   emphasis on QCD parton showers.
  It contains,among others, the following features:
  - QCD jet evolution with soft gluon interference via angular ordering
  - Azimuthal correlations within and between jets due to interference
  - Azimuthal correlations within jets due to gluon polarization
  - Cluster hadronization of jets via non-perturbative gluon splitting.
 
  With respect to version 5.0 the following new features have been added
  - A correction to hard gluon emission to add events in the regin of
    phase space corresponding to a q-qbar pair recoiling from a very hard
    gluon
  - Photons are now included in time-like parton showering with a
    corresponding correction to that above applied.
    Alpha-em is multiplied by a factor ALPFAC to improve efficiency
    of photon FSR studies. ALPFAC should not be set greater than 5.
  - A new parameter B1LIM has been introduced to control B cluster
    hadronization.
  - B decays can additionally be performed by the EURODEC or CLEO Monte
    Carlo packages.
  - the variable SUDORD is introduced to control the calculation
    of the Sudakov form factors. This should have little effect in
    this version, but be significant in the future.
  - CLPOW is included in the condition to control the decay of heavy
    clusters. This was previously fixed at 2. and lower values increase
    the yield of heavier clusters and hence of baryons for heavy quarks.
  - The entries for partons before hadronization are retained. To
    distinguish these partons from those arising from gluon splitting
    a second mother (actually the grandmother) has been included
    in the output.
  - The maximum number of outgoing partons in a hard subprocess is now
    set at 200
 
  Versions 5.7 includes the following new features
  - Incoming lepton and antilepton beam polarisations can be
    specified in vectors with 2 transverse components and one
    longitudinal.
  - Anisotropic cluster decay when a cluster contains a quark from
    the perturbative stage, all previous decays were isotropic.
  - Fictional processes for gluon-gluon production to allow direct
    comparisons between quark and gluon jets.
  - The introduction of an eta/eta' mixing angle.
 
  The following parameters can be used to tune to the data (done by
  Gerald Rudolph on version 5.6 with and without anisotropic cluster
  decay).
  - QCDLAM (Lambda-QCD, default value 0.18 GeV): Can be identified
    with Lambda-MSbar but only at high momentum fractions (x or z).
  - RMASS(13) (effective gluon mass, default value 0.75 GeV)
  - CLMAX maximum allowed mass of a cluster made from 2 quarks (default
    value 3.35)
  - VQCUT a cutoff added to quark masses in the parton showers to avoid
    divergences (default 0.48)
  - VGCUT as above added to gluon masses (default 0.10)
  - VPCUT the analogous quantity for photon emission, the default is
    root(s) - no emission; data indicate it is insensitive to its exact
    value in the range 0.1-1.0 .
  The following parameters have made available to provide additional
  possibilities to tune to the data. They are all relative
  normalised weights (defaults = 1.).
  - TENWT production of tensor mesons in fragmentation
  - VECWT production of vector mesons in fragmentation
  - DECWT production of decuplet baryons in fragmentation
  - PWT(i) i=1,7 weights for d,u,s,c,b,t and diquarks in that order
 
  An interface to DYMU3 has been added to provide the initial process
  including initial state radiation but not final state. Electroweak
  parameters are taken from the HERWIG values. To use set the IHARD
  parameter on the GENE card to 3.
 
  NOTE: The interface to Jetset 6.3 to provide initial and final
  state radiation (GENE values 1 and 2) has been removed.
 
  NOTE: Herwig is primarily a q-qbar generator, however, all relevant
  e+e- processes have now been made available. These include
  e+e- --> W+W- , ZZ , ZH production and 2-photon processes. They
  have not been fully tested even in Herwig itself so should be
  used with caution. If problems are encountered please inform those
  responsible, as indeed for the q-qbar processes.
 
  More information about HERWIG itself can be found in the references, in
   particular ref 3.5 describes version 5.4 .

will allow decay at generator level of all particles with a proper lifetime
less than ct0 seconds.

1. code I.D.  : HEAVY FLAVOR group Monte-Carlo built for its own needs
               interfaced from December 1990 to February 1991.JETSET7.3 version
               contact people : B.Bloch-Devaux & Alain Falvard.
 
2. write-up   :
  HVFL04 is an extension of HFLV02 and HVFL03 .All features present in the
previous versions are available and additional functions have been added.
 
  HVFL02 name was used up to version 1.02 , then following versions were
named as HVFL03 up to version 1.03 , HVFL04 starts with version 1.04
to help production book-keeping.
  The new features added are :
  - new option for semileptonic decay of B baryons
   (GLAM card ,including spin and/or form factor effects )
  - new option for flavour dependent fraction of T/V
   ( GP17 card including one ratio per flavor)
  - new print/debug option : an automatic call to LUTABU routine which
    gives a useful events analysis in terms of particles contents can
    be switched on using the value 10 of flag IPPART in GHVF card.
    Remember that all B0 ( d or s ) appear twice because of mixing
    implementation....
  - new possibility to generate some particular decay chain .
    The card GDDC defines the chain as the decay of a b-Hadron into a
    c-Hadron and possibly up to 2 possible companions .
    In that case it forces the c-hadron to decay into a set of decay
    modes selected by switches.
    If the c-Hadron is produced in another configuration its decay modes
    are not affected.
 
    b_hadron ---> c_hadron + 0,1 companions ( among 2 )
                     |
                      ---> selected decays
 
 REMEMBER : if you use this option and write out events on file/tape
  only events satisfying the defined configuration will appear on
  the output file . Furthermore , if you want a given number of
  such events , give this number as the 3rd quantity on the TRIG card
  the program will loop over events until it reaches your number of
  selected events whatever is the last event number required.

1. code I.D.  : original version HERWIG 5.8 from B. Webber et al.
                Transmitted in August 1994,
                interfaced in 1994 by A.S.Thompson using code
                written by E.Lange for previous HERWIG versions.
                contact people : A.S.Thompson and B.Bloch.
 
2. write-up   :
  The HERWIG (Hadron Emission Reactions With Interfering Gluons)Monte-Carlo
   event generator was written by G. Marchesini and B.R. Webber. It is
   designed to simulate high energy hadronic processes with particular
   emphasis on QCD parton showers.
  It contains,among others, the following features:
  - QCD jet evolution with soft gluon interference via angular ordering
  - Azimuthal correlations within and between jets due to interference
  - Azimuthal correlations within jets due to gluon polarization
  - Cluster hadronization of jets via non-perturbative gluon splitting.
 
  With respect to version 5.0 the following new features have been added
  - A correction to hard gluon emission to add events in the regin of
    phase space corresponding to a q-qbar pair recoiling from a very hard
    gluon
  - Photons are now included in time-like parton showering with a
    corresponding correction to that above applied.
    Alpha-em is multiplied by a factor ALPFAC to improve efficiency
    of photon FSR studies. ALPFAC should not be set greater than 5.
  - A new parameter B1LIM has been introduced to control B cluster
    hadronization.
  - B decays can additionally be performed by the EURODEC or CLEO Monte
    Carlo packages.
  - the variable SUDORD is introduced to control the calculation
    of the Sudakov form factors. This should have little effect in
    this version, but be significant in the future.
  - CLPOW is included in the condition to control the decay of heavy
    clusters. This was previously fixed at 2. and lower values increase
    the yield of heavier clusters and hence of baryons for heavy quarks.
  - The entries for partons before hadronization are retained. To
    distinguish these partons from those arising from gluon splitting
    a second mother (actually the grandmother) has been included
    in the output.
  - The maximum number of outgoing partons in a hard subprocess is now
    set at 200
  - Incoming lepton and antilepton beam polarisations can be
    specified in vectors with 2 transverse components and one
    longitudinal.
  - Fictional processes for gluon-gluon production to allow direct
    comparisons between quark and gluon jets.
  - The introduction of an eta/eta' mixing angle.
 
  Version 5.8 includes the following new or modified features
  - Anisotropic cluster decay when a cluster contains a quark from
    the perturbative stage, all previous decays were isotropic.
    The direction of the perturbative quark's momentum can be smeared,
    increasing this smearing decorrelates the cluster decay from the
    initial quark direction.
  - Soft matrix element corrections match have been introduced such
    that the hardest emissions is matched to the leading order
    matrix element (JETSET matches to the first emission).
  - Alpha EM now runs.
 
  The following parameters can be used to tune to the data (done by
  Gerald Rudolph on version 5.6 with and without anisotropic cluster
  decay).
  - QCDLAM (Lambda-QCD, default value 0.18 GeV): Can be identified
    with Lambda-MSbar but only at high momentum fractions (x or z).
  - RMASS(13) (effective gluon mass, default value 0.75 GeV)
  - CLMAX maximum allowed mass of a cluster made from 2 quarks (default
    value 3.35)
  - VQCUT a cutoff added to quark masses in the parton showers to avoid
    divergences (default 0.48)
  - VGCUT as above added to gluon masses (default 0.10)
  - VPCUT the analogous quantity for photon emission, the default is
    root(s) - no emission; data indicate it is insensitive to its exact
    value in the range 0.1-1.0 .
  The following parameters have made available to provide additional
  possibilities to tune to the data. They are all relative
  normalised weights (defaults = 1.).
  - TENWT production of tensor mesons in fragmentation
  - VECWT production of vector mesons in fragmentation
  - DECWT production of decuplet baryons in fragmentation
  - PWT(i) i=1,7 weights for d,u,s,c,b,t and diquarks in that order
 
  An interface to DYMU3 has been added to provide the initial process
  including initial state radiation but not final state. Electroweak
  parameters are taken from the HERWIG values. To use set the IHARD
  parameter on the GENE card to 3.
 
  NOTE: The interface to Jetset 6.3 to provide initial and final
  state radiation (GENE values 1 and 2) has been removed.
 
  NOTE: all relevant e+e- processes have now been made available.
  These include e+e- --> W+W- , ZZ , ZH production and 2-photon processes.
  Bugs had been found inside Herwig which prevented parton showers
  from the decays of colour neutral particles. These have been corrected
  and people are now encouraged to use them for LEP2 studies.
  If problems are encountered in these, or q-qbar processes,
  please inform those responsible.
 
  More information about HERWIG itself can be found in the references, in
   particular ref 3.5 describes version 5.4 .

 It may seem easier to use a data card KTMX to handle the stability of
particles at generator level :   KTMX   ct0
will allow decay at generator level of all particles with a proper
lifetime less than ct0 seconds.

6. comments   :
 
 6.1 If the user wants to change any other parameter within HERWIG, he
can do this in the user initialization routine USTART .
 
 6.2 The HERWIG event listing contains some 'objects' which are not
particles (jet cones etc.), they are just skipped when filling KINE banks.
The beam electrons are stored in KINE banks (negative number) as usual.
The exchanged vector boson Z0/gamma is linked to the primary vertex as
well as a possible initial state radiative photon. Final state radiated
photons link to their parent quark and appear among the partons before
hadronization.
In the HERWIG event listing the same particle may appear several times
(with different status codes). It only will be stored once in the BOS
banks.
Note, that the KHIS bank information is not compatible with the LUND
History code. For cluster fragmentation and to indicate partons before
hadronization a 'daughter' can have two mothers.
The entries in 'KHIS' look like
             KS*1000000 + IMOTH2*1000 + IMOTH1.
where KS is the HERWIG status code, IMOTH1 and IMOTH2 denote the entries
of the 'mothers' of the particle.
For 'normal' particles IMOTH2 = 0. Particles which appear several times
in the HERWIG event listing only have one entry in this 'KHIS' bank.
 
6.3 The original version of HERWIG 5.5 uses an explicitly written version
of RANMAR. This has been changed to use the KINGAL version so the seed as
supplied by the RMAR card is always used.
 
6.4 The particle masses are always taken from the ALEPH particle table as
long as they are available. Note, that the masses of the top-mesons, top-
baryons and the diquarks are computed in HERWIG by simply adding the
quarks masses (neglecting any binding energy).

 recognised through data cards ( MSTU,MSTJ,PARU,PARJ,PMA1,MDC1....)
 The generator can be run in a qqbar mode with mixed or single flavor
 or in a single particle mode for decay modes studies.

5. header informations :
 5.1 run header
   One parameter bank KPAR is created and data cards used as explained
above are also kept as BOS Banks at the beginning of the file. So it is
highly recommended to make use of this facility to modify default values
of the Lund parameters.
   Parameter bank 'KPAR' contains  5 real*4 values corresponding to :
     TABL(1) =IFL                         TABL(2) = ECMS
     TABL(3) =smearing of x_vertex        TABL(4) = smearing of y_vertex
     TABL(5) =smearing of z_vertex
 
   Integer values are stored as real; SVRT corresponds to the smearing of
the vertex position (in cm).
 
 
 5.2 event header
   Process identifier IDPR = Flavor code of the generated event(1 digit
per qqbar flavor ).
In case of mixed flavor run, the event is analysed to give in this word
the flavor generated (the second flavor generated in the event appears
as the lowest decimal digit, that is 21 means ddbar quarks plus a uubar
pair).
 
   Weight :can be ignored as all events have weight 1.
 
   Center of mass energy ECMS = as defined by the user in the Data card.

0. platforms : IBM ALWS AXP/VMS CSF SHIFT50 OSF
   additionnal code needed : JETSET74 library
 
1. code I.D.  : original version FERMISV (J. Hilgart and R. Kleiss)
                QED Corrections (F. Le Diberder)
                QCD Corrections (P. Janot)
                transmitted in 1992
                interfaced in October 1994;
                contact people : P.Janot/B.Bloch.
 
2. write-up   :
   This program is intended to generate four fermion final states
in e+e- collisions, from all the lowest order diagrams involving
gamma and Z exchange :
 
                  e+e- ---> f f(bar) f' f'(bar)
 
The initial and final state photon radiation are optionally inclu-
ded (with interferences between the initial and final states) with
up to five photons generated.
 
When one of the fermion pair is made of quarks, the non-perturbative
part of the QCD corrections is simulated using a parameterization
of all known J(PC)=1-- resonances and of the experimental R-ratio.
Hadronization and decays are simulated with JETSET 7.4.
 
This generator is definitely not reliable when all the final
state fermions are quarks, in which case a pure QCD generator
(e.g. JETSET) is much better suited. When one of the fermion pair
is a neutrino pair, diagrams with W exchange (which are not in-
cluded) cannot be neglected. A program like EXCALIBUR should be
used in that case.
 
IMPORTANT :  the user should be aware that he should first run the
program in the weighted events mode (IWEIGH =0) without saving the events
A sample of 2000 events is enough to get a realistic maximum weight .
This weight ( WTMAX ) appears as follows in the output :
 
 
+++ THE FINAL COMBINED RESULT +++
Min. weight                 0.73396925017E-04 pb
Max. weight                  4.1727521818     pb      <=== WTMAX
Efficiency (=sigma/max wt) 11.7923 %
*** CROSS SECTION ***       0.49206232739     pb +/- 0.12112948852E-01 pb
Interference                1.0234 %
Cross section w/ soft phots 0.67146542787     pb +/- 0.17224219895E-01 pb
 
To get a file of events , run the program in unweighted events mode
(IWEIGH =1 ) and a value a WTMAX*2 to be safe .
 
The following changes have been made:
 2.1 Changes to the original code
    -the input parameters are now read from BOS data cards, and
     not from the routine PROSET;
    -the main program FERMIS turned into a SUBROUTINE called
     once every 127 events;
    -the routine WRITE (to write out events) has been removed from
     the code;
 2.2 Changes to the interface code.
     None, yet.

6. comments   :
   - Final state radiation is not compatible with final states
     containing 4 neutrinos. Fixed by setting FSR to zero !!!
   - Neutrino masses must be set to a small non-zero value
     (e.g. 0.1 MeV/c2) to avoid rounding errors in the program.
   - It is strongly recommended to always run with switches ISR,FSR and
     QCD "ON" .

* Short Summary:
*    Color reconnection is based on the overlap in time and space of
*    the two W systems. The extension of the system in time is described
*    by a Gaussian with sigma TFRAG. The spacial size is described
*    either by a sphere or a cylinder Gaussian distributed radius with
*    sigma RHAD or a vortex.
*
*    TFRAG : Sigma of the timal distribution of the two W systems.
*    RHAD  : Sigma of the distribution of radius of sphere/cylinder
*    RPROB : Strength of reconnection probability
*
*  Recommended values:  RHAD   RPROB (see Reference above)
*            Sphere   :  0.5    0.6
*            Cylinder :  0.7    0.6

* Kinematic cuts on specified processes
*
* PROC :  Final state for which cuts apply (Notation as for PROC-card)
*         In case of redundant specified final states/cuts the last
*         specification apply.
*         Setting PROC=-5 invoke special "minimal" cut-option, where a
*         cut is applied only on the angle between the incomming e (e~)
*         and the outgoing e (e~) to avoid the Bremsstrahlung pole.
*         The cut in cos-theta is given by SHCUT (the other
*         cuts have to be given for the card to be accepted - but they
*         are _NOT_ used).
*         Remember that PROC=0 and PROC=-5 _MUST_ be specified in first
*         CUTS-card, ie. only one of them can be specified.
*         Setting PROC=-1xx, where xx = 01(d-quark),...,16(n_tau) one can
*         specify cuts on particle-type basis. Possibilities are
*                SHCUT  : Minimum energy of particle AND antiparticle
*                ECUT(3): Cut on cos-theta between incoming electron
*                         (positron) and the outgoing (anti)particle
*                ECUT(4): Cut on cos-theta between incoming positron
*                         (electron) and the outgoing (anti)particle
*                ECUT(5): Minimum invariant mass squared of any
*                         particle-antiparticle pair in a final state.
*         Again the other cuts have to be given for the card to be accepted -
*         but they are _NOT_ used.
*
* In general we have:
* SHCUT : Invariant mass of colliding e+e- after ISR.
* ECUT(3-6) : Energy cuts on four outgoing fermions
* SCUT(34)-SCUT(56) : Cuts on min inv. mass of pairs of outgoing fermions
* CMAX(13)-CMAX(56) : Cuts on cos-theta between incoming(1,2) and out-
*                     going(4-6) fermions, and on cos-thetas between out-
*                     going fermion pairs.

    **************
 
0. platforms : AXP/VMS  CSF Aloha shift50
 
1. code I.D.  : HEAVY FLAVOUR group Monte-Carlo built for its own needs
               interfaced from December 1994 to January 1995. This is the
               JETSET7.4 version
               contact people : B.Bloch-Devaux
 
2. write-up   :
  HVFL05 is an extension of HFLV02 to HVFL04 .All features present in the
previous versions are available and additional functions have been added.
  HVFL05 starts with version 1.00 and a new generator code number 5030.
  A summary of the available features is given here together with the
corresponding control data card :
 
  2.1  Z0 decay and quark fragmentation into hadrons
 
  GHVF    Producer options  as before (but BREM5 is no longer supported)
          depending on the option choosen one of the following 3 cards is
          needed :
  GLUN    if  IGENE =1 JETSET 7.4 and Parton shower
  GDYM    if  IGENE =3 DYMU3 interfaced to Parton shower  (load DYMU02 )
  GSIN    if  IGENE =-1 Single particle mode for tests

          Possible option ARIADNE instead of Parton shower when the
          decimal digit is on ( that is IGENE = 11 or 13 ) .One should
          then load ARIA04 library in addition.
          This option had to be rewritten in January 1999 in order to
          cope with the code reshuffling of ARIADNE ( from version 4.01)
          which changed commons, calling sequences, ....
          To get a reasaonnable agreement for multiplicities, one should
          use a slightly modified setup of JETSET. However, this is not
          perfect as it was NOT tuned excatly in HVFL conditions !
 
  All switches and parameters of JETSET can be activated through data
cards ( MSTJ , PARJ , MSTU ,PARU , PMA1 etc...)
  For fragmentation , parameters may depend upon the quark flavour
 
  GP13    flavour dependent fraction of V/P for c and b at fragm. step
          2 numbers are expected on the GP13 card .Do not forget that the
          corresponding values for lighter quarks are defined by PARJ(11)
          and PARJ(12)
  GP14    flavour dependent fraction of S 0 L 1 J 1 at fragm. step
  GP15    flavour dependent fraction of S 1 L 1 J 0 at fragm. step
  GP16    flavour dependent fraction of S 1 L 1 J 1 at fragm. step
  GP17    flavour dependent fraction of T/V at production step(fragment)
  GP02    flavour dependent fraction of s/u at production step(fragment)
          4 numbers expected on the GP02,GP14 to GP17 cards corresponding
          to u(d) , s , c and b quarks .
          this last card not to be used for the moment

          and restored once the decay is done.
          Models include 3 semi leptonic and 2 hadronic modes ( in terms
          of spectator diagrams ) , with different Br's.
  GBUS    allows to define usermade decay chains .
 
  GPHO    internal Brem within B and D semileptonic decays and leptonic
          decays of Psi and Psi' using the PHOTOS Library .
 
  GLAM    include spin and/or form factor effects in semileptonic decay
          of B baryons
 
  There are still some large unknowns in the hadronic decay schemes of
  /\c  and all b_hadrons . A large fraction is thus defined as spectator
  diagrams where the c (b) quarks decays as W  s (c) , the companion
  quark ( diquark) playing no role .Hadronisation is then done according
  to the setup of the PARJ parameters .To be able to use different values
  from those used in fragmentation ,one can use the following cards :
  GBDK    flavour dependent fraction of any of the first 20 PARJ at B
          decay step ( used in hadronisation of spectator diags)
  GCDK    flavour dependent fraction of any of the first 20 PARJ at D
          decay step ( used in hadronisation of spectator diags)
  For the 2 cards the format is :
  GXDK ii parj(ii)  jj  parj(jj) ...  with X= B or C and as many couples
  (ii,parj(ii)) as necessary .
  Only the first 20 PARJ values are accessible
 
   Possibility of modifying modes for any particle
  GRPL    Redefinition of one or several decay modes
  GADM    Addition of more decay modes
  GMOB    Modification of Branching ratios
 
  2.3  Tau decays
 
  The 7.4 version of JETSET allows to use an external library to perform
tau decays . If MSTJ(28)=2 , this option becomes active and a dedicated
routine LUTAUD is called .
  An interface to TAUOLA has been built inside LUTAUD which takes into
account the polarization effects in the decays of B-->Tau Nutau X.
  Extra binary file and libraries need to be loaded : 
 KIN:LUTAUD.OBJ, KIN:KORL07.OLB and KIN:DIZET_W.OLB ( VAX and AXP).
 /afs/cern.ch/aleph/aleph/kin/lutaud.o, libkorl07.a and libdizet_w.a (Unix)
 When a tau has been decayed , its polarization is kept in the standard
 KPOL bank .
 
  2.4  Special decays
  GDDC    Select events containing a given decay mode  of a B-Hadron
          into a C-Hadron and possibly up to 2 companions .In that case
          it forces the c-hadron to decay into a subset of decay modes
          selected by switches.
          If the c-Hadron is produced in another configuration its decay
          modes are not affected.
          Only events satisfying the defined configuration will appear on
          the output file . Furthermore , if you want a given number of
          such events , give this number as the 3rd quantity on the TRIG
          card ,the program will loop over events until it reaches your
          number of selected events ignoring total number of events
          given as 2nd number of the TRIG card.

6. comments   :
 
  - Fragmentation z information is kept in KZFR bank. Mother's z is
 transmitted all the way down the decay chain particles.KZFR is tranlated
 into FZFR when KINE is translated to FKIN bank.
  - Polarization info of the Tau is stored in KPOL when available.
  - The JETSET 7.4 LUDECY code has been modified to
          - handle the Psi'--> Psi pi pi amplitude
          - give the right relative fraction of Psi,Psi',Etac ,chi1c in
          B-mesons decays:
  A modified version of LUKFDI is kept in the Library to allow flavor
  dependent parameters at hadronisation time.

   - use the .opt file to build the job as you need the right loadind sequence of
 libraries ( and block data's)

1. code I.D.  : original version ( PYTHIA 5.7) from Hans-Uno Bengtsson
                Department of Theoretical Physics, University of Uppsala
                and Torbjorn Sjostrand (TORSJO@CERNVM )
                interfaced by M.FRANK and B. Bloch as from first version
                contact people : Markus Frank (FRANKM@CERNVM)
 
2. write-up   :
PYTHIA is a program intended for the study of hadronic processes.
Historically, this has meant incoming hadron, but today also lepton
beams are included, so that e.g. e+e- and ep events can be generated,
in addition to pp ones. (Further combinations, involving antiprotons,
neutrons, pions, photons, muons, etc., are also possible.) For
completeness, it is also possible to generate a few non-hadronic
final states. In hadronic interactions, the emphasis is on high-pT
physics, but PYTHIA also covers the domain of low-pT interactions
as an integral part of the total cross-section. In its present form it
includes hard scattering matrix elements, structure functions and
initial and final state parton showers. Fragmentation is performed using
the ordinary Lund fragmentation model, JETSET version 7.4, but an
important task for PYTHIA is to set up the correct string configuration,
particularly nontrivial for the low-pT target remnants.
  The present version is interfaced assuming LEP operation , that is
electron-positron beams within the Aleph Reference system convention.
 
  All modifications to version 5.7 are documented in a file on the IBM
on disk TORSJO 192 as UPDATE57 NOTES

6. comments   :
   This version has to be exercised as it can be used in many
 configurations.
   The beam particles are stored in the KINE banks #-1 and -2 as usual
 but do not appear in the /LUJETS/ common block
   The history which keeps track of the mother of quarks produced in
 Z,W,H decays is now taken ( hopefully) into account.
   Thanks to Markus Frank the user can modify the PYTHIA parameters

    *************
 
0. platforms : IBM ALWS AXP/VMS  CSF SHIFT50 OSF
 
1. code I.D.  : updated version (LEPWW) from R.Miquel and M.Schmitt
                transmitted in May 1995
                contact people : R.Miquel and M.Schmitt
 
2. write-up   :
 
    The LEPWW Monte Carlo program written by R.Kleiss to calculate cross
sections has been used as the basis for a complete event generator for
the process
            e+e-   ---->  (W+W- or ZZ)  ----->   four fermions
 
Kleiss's calculation employed helicity amplitude techniques, so it takes
all interferences and boson polarization into account.  The bosons are
assumed to resonate; their propagators are described by Breit-Wigners.
    Several enhancements to the original calcualtion were made, including
initial-state radiation, corrected couplings, definite flavor generation,
coulomb singularity, an improved generation of ZZ masses, mass-dependent
widths, final-state radiation for electrons and muons using PHOTOS,
cabibbo-mixing, and parton showers and fragmentation using JETSET 7.3.
The event generator is fully interfaced to KINGAL.
    The events are unweighted.
 
Changes with respect to LPWW01:
 - fix bug which prevented hard gluon radiation
 - Cabbibo mixing moved into s/r CHOOSE
 - use better calculation of coulomb singularity (s/r COULB)
 - provide run-time options for FSR, Hadronization, ZZ diagrams
 - quark color connection reflects phase space choice
 - color factors include alfas/pi correction, for quarks
 - user can provide own values for W and Z widths
 - fix bug in cos(theta) generation which caused inefficiency
 - fix minor kinematic bugs
 
    The ALEPH interface code (LPWW02 historian file) and the generator
itself (LPWW02.ORIGINE) have been separated.

    5035 - KRLW02
    *************
 
0. platforms  : AXP/VMS  CSF SHIFT50/Aloha Linux
 
1. code I.D.  : original version (KORALW1.21) by Skrzypek,Jadach,Placzek,Was;
                extension of KORALW1.02 (interfaced by P.Perez and B.Bloch as
                  KRLW01) to include 4-f bkg diagrams via GRACEv2.0 package;
                transmitted in June 1996 by A.Valassi;
                interfaced by A.Valassi;
                contact people: A.Valassi.

2. write-up   :

  Main features of KORALW version 1.21 / NEW features w.r.t. KORALW1.02
  -Multiple soft ISR photons with FINITE transverse momenta
   generated according to YFS Monte Carlo technique.
  -Massive kinematics for all particles.
  -Massless Internal Born (CC3) matrix element.
  -NEW: Anomalous WWV couplings in internal (CC3) matrix el.
        Convention of K. Hagiwara, R.D. Peccei, D. Zeppenfeld and K. Hikasa, 
                      Nucl. Phys. B282 (1987) 253.
  -NEW: Coulomb effect included
  -NEW: Interface to  to Grace v. 2.0 package for all W decay channels
        (interface to any other external matrix element is also possible).
        Gluon diagrams (eg. in uudd) are included in the code but switched off
        (hard-wired).
        Higgs diagrams are included in the code and switched on (hard-wired).
        The electron-Higgs couplings are neglected.
        External matrix element needs fixed W and Z widths; be aware of the
        corresponding mass shifts!
  -NEW: Optional presampler for more complicated  than just WW breit wigner 
        enhancements over phase space in unweighted event generation.
  -Matrix element with QED second order LL initial state radiation.
  -All final state configurations according to branching ratios.
   Branching ratios are either Born or corrected for CKM and QCD effects
   (for hard-wired values of CKM matrix and alphaQCD).
   Internal CC3 approximation is used in CKM non-diagonal W-decays even if 
   external matrix element is turned on.
  -Interface to TAUOLA, PHOTOS and JETSET
  -NEW: String connection in JETSET in WW/ZZ hadronic final states (eg. uudd)
        follows WW or ZZ configuration with probabilities proportional to 
        the matrix element squared for WW or ZZ diagrams.
  -Semianalytical routine KORWAN is included in the package (CC3 only).
  -KORALW was tested against semianalytical results of KORWAN (CC3 only), 
   and the technical precision on total cross section (with and without 
   photons) was found to be of order 1d-4 or better in the LEP2 energy range

  Main limitations of KORALW version 1.21
  - no anomalous WWV couplings in external GRACE 4-fermion matrix element
  - only 'WW-like' 4-fermion final states (eg. no e+e-e+e-) 
  - QED corrections only in Initial State or in W decay
  - no 'color reconnection'
  -NEW : interface to ARIADNE for hadronisation instead of JETSET with the
   possibility of several color reconnection schemes. Use IPSHO =2 and
   switch on the appropriate setup of ARIADNE + JETSET.

  -NEW : possibility to generate different central masses for W+ and W-'s
  -NEW : implementation of "screened" Coulomb correction ( KeyCul=2)
  -NEW : store original kinematics from ISR photons and 4 fermions from w decays before FSR
         in bank KW4F ( see description in bank section of the documentation)

   its block data. In addition for ARIADNE option, ARIADNE 4.10 and its block 
   data. If one uses the .opt file , all this is done for you !

   With setting KeySmp = MOD(KeyTek,1000)/100=1 multiple channel 4-body phase 
   space is getting activated. This is necessary if one want to generate 
   events accordingly to matrix element strongly peaked in other regions of 
   phase space than just regions enhanced by two WW breit-wigners. For this 
   purpose the same technique as described in TAUOLA paper [Comp. Phys. Commun.
   76 (1993) 361] was used. See there, formula (20) and related explanations. 
   In short an algorithm splits and accordingly to predefined probabilities 
   phase space point is generated accordingly to one of algorithm branches. 
   Finally an overall phase-space weight is calculated as a probability 
   weighted (inverse harmonic) average of weights for all generation branches.
   So far the following branches have been introduced, which are now combined
   with probabilities 0.3, 0.1, 0.2, 0.2, 0.1, 0.1 respectively:
   1)  Old like in koralw 1.02 WW generation  channel in invariant masses of:
       (1+2) (3+4) pairs from final state 4-fermion states. 
       In this case there is a lot of events generated if invariant 
       mass of a pair of first and second fermion and third and fourth 
       fermion are close to W mass. These events have however vey small 
       phase space weight which will cancel peaks in matrix
       element in an overall weight. Making overall weight relatively flat.
       We will call it, and similarily in other cases below, as: 
       (W)(W) enhancement channel in in (1+2) (3+4) final state fermion pairs.
       Analogously: (Z)     denotes enhancement for Z propagator
                    (gamma) enhancement for photon exchange propagator (peak at 
                            small invariant mass)
                    (flat)  just flat distribution in the given invariant mass
                            squared. 
       These are in cases below sometimes  combined, so far with equal 
       probabilities; no optimalization.
   2)  No enhancement channel
   3)  (Z+flat+gamma)(Z+flat+gamma) enhancement channel
       in (1+4) (2+3) final state fermion pairs.
   4)  (W+flat+gamma)(W+flat+gamma) enhancement channel
       in (1+2) (3+4) final state fermion pairs. With additional collinear
       singularity enhancement for final state fermions nr 1 and 4 collinear
       with the beam. 
   5)  (Z+flat+gamma)(Z+flat+gamma) enhancement channel. 
       in (1+4) (2+3) final state fermion pairs. With additional collinear
       singularity  enhancementfor final state fermions nr 1 and 3 collinear
       with the beam.  
   6)  (Z+flat+gamma)(Z+flat+gamma) enhancement channel
       in (1+4) (2+3) final state fermion pairs. With additional collinear
       singularity  enhancement for final state fermions nr 2 and 4 collinear
       with the beam. 
   In addition, primary cut at the low level of MC generation  is set 
   [in the original Koralw1.21 code] if invariant mass**2 of any pair of the 
   final state fermions is smaller than 9 GeV**2  and if any of final state 
   fermion is  closer to the beam than |cos(theta_beam)| = 0.96. 
   [NB: These settings are superseeded by user cuts in KRLW02 interface!]
   Why introduce such a trick?
   These primary cuts  can be set much lower and in principle full phase-space 
   may be covered. This would degrade the quality of the generation as 
   substantially over-weighted events start then to appear. One can counter it 
   by introducing even further  parallel generation channels corresponding 
   e.g. to the splitting of one of incoming beam into an electron and photon 
   with secondary split of the photon into light fermion pair of small mass  
   (order-alpha**2 leading-log-like effects).This is however physically 
   incorrect anyway, as such configurations should be included 
   at the same step as initial state bremsstrahlung (and for that reason belong
   to initial state order alpha**2 QED correction for the 2-fermion final 
   states). In addition it would slow down the algorithm. In general, algorithm 
   slows down at best as number of generating channels. Increase of the maximum 
   weight is another possibility in this case.
   For the purpose of LEP 2 physics the authors find the speed not to be a 
   major problem anyway. That is why they did not came through the painful 
   (work requiring) tuning of the presampler parameters (see the above branch
   probabilities) as a function of center of mass energy and particular 
   generated final state flavours.

   In KRLW02, the above primary cuts are replaced by user cuts defined
   through the cards GCE0, GCE1, GCE2 and GCUU.
   Card GCE0 is only supposed to provide very general user cuts,
   inluding the original ones of Koralw1.21 (discussed above) and also those 
   applicable in Excalibur (to allow comparisons to it).
   The other three cards provide cuts affecting only those particular classes 
   of (4f-) events which are likely to be over-weighted (unless very high 
   maximum weights are used, resulting in very slow execution); these classes 
   of events are not likely to be seen or selected as WW events anyway.
   Card GCE1 is useful against semileptonic events with an electron or positron 
   along the beam pipe; its settings are also applied to fully leptonic events
   with at least one electron or positron.
   Card GCE2 is useful against fully leptonic e+e-nu~nu events with low
   invariant mass (corresponding to photon conversion diagrams) and/or low 
   transverse momentum.
   Card GCUU is useful against uudd events with a low invariant mass for
   the uu and/or dd system.

1. code I.D.  : original version HERWIG 5.9 from B. Webber et al.
                Transmitted in July 1996,
                interfaced in 1996 by A.S.Thompson using code
                written by E.Lange for previous HERWIG versions.
                contact people : A.S.Thompson and B.Bloch.
                                 M.Lehto for 2-photon processes.

2. write-up   :
  The HERWIG (Hadron Emission Reactions With Interfering Gluons)Monte-Carlo
   event generator was written by G. Marchesini and B.R. Webber. It is
   designed to simulate high energy hadronic processes with particular
   emphasis on QCD parton showers.
  It contains,among others, the following features:
  - QCD jet evolution with soft gluon interference via angular ordering
  - Azimuthal correlations within and between jets due to interference
  - Azimuthal correlations within jets due to gluon polarization
  - Cluster hadronization of jets via non-perturbative gluon splitting.

  With respect to version 5.0 the following new features have been added
  - A correction to hard gluon emission to add events in the region of
    phase space corresponding to a q-qbar pair recoiling from a very hard
    gluon
  - Photons are now included in time-like parton showering with a
    corresponding correction to that above applied.
    Alpha-em is multiplied by a factor ALPFAC to improve efficiency
    of photon FSR studies. ALPFAC should not be set greater than 5.
  - A new parameter B1LIM has been introduced to control B cluster
    hadronization.
  - B decays can additionally be performed by the EURODEC or CLEO Monte
    Carlo packages.
  - the variable SUDORD is introduced to control the calculation
    of the Sudakov form factors. This should have little effect in
    this version, but be significant in the future.
  - CLPOW is included in the condition to control the decay of heavy
    clusters. This was previously fixed at 2. and lower values increase
    the yield of heavier clusters and hence of baryons for heavy quarks.
  - The entries for partons before hadronization are retained. To
    distinguish these partons from those arising from gluon splitting
    a second mother (actually the grandmother) has been included
    in the output.
  - The maximum number of outgoing partons in a hard subprocess is now
    set at 200
  - Incoming lepton and antilepton beam polarisations can be
    specified in vectors with 2 transverse components and one
    longitudinal.
  - Fictional processes for gluon-gluon production to allow direct
    comparisons between quark and gluon jets.
  - The introduction of an eta/eta' mixing angle.
  - Anisotropic cluster decay when a cluster contains a quark from
    the perturbative stage, all previous decays were isotropic.
    The direction of the perturbative quark's momentum can be smeared,
    increasing this smearing decorrelates the cluster decay from the
    initial quark direction.
  - Soft matrix element corrections match have been introduced such
    that the hardest emissions is matched to the leading order
    matrix element (JETSET matches to the first emission).
  - Alpha EM now runs.

  Version 5.9 includes the following new or modified features
  - Introduction of 8 character particle names and the use of 7 digit
    PDG numbering scheme. Many new particles have been added, but the
    correspondence with the ALEPH particles has been followed as
    closely as possible.
  - Particle lifetimes have been introduced, once again the ALEPH values
    are used where available. Particles with lifetimes greater than
    PLTCUT are set stable, if MAXDKL=.true. decays outside a given
    cylindrical volume about the vertex are not allowed. If PRVTX=.true.
    decay vertex information is printed, but the vertex is regenerated
    by ALEPH routines (which allow for the magnetic field).
  - B meson oscillations are allowed if MIXING=.true., the mass and width
    differences are contained in the variables XMIX and YMIX.
  - Initial state radiation is allowed, TMNISR sets the minimum s-hat/s
    value, ZMXISR sets the separation between unresolved and resolved
    emission (set to 0 to turn ISR off) and COLISR=.true. forces the
    photon to be collinear with the beam.
  - New particle and decay tables have been introduced, this makes it
    possible to add or change parameters or decay modes. This feature
    is not yet used in the interface, people should contact the author
    if they want this, but in the meantime refer to the Herwig5.9 writeup
    for details.
  - Colour rearrangement model, used if CLRECO=.true. with a probability
    factor PRECO. A parameter EXAG can articially scale the lifetimes
    of weak bosons.
  - New gamma-gamma processes are now available, those currently accepted
    by the interface are:-
      QPM  gamma gamma --> qqbar/llbar/WW
      VDM  soft processes
      QCD  single and double resolved and heavy quark production
      DIS  for tagged electrons.
    Adding 10000 to the process number removes the soft underlying processes,
    this is useful for tagged events, but meaningless for VDM.
==> Note the parameters controlling these processes need to be tuned carefully,
==> the wrong settings will lead to many warning concerned the efficiency of
==> the program and possible termination of the run. Also some parameters
==> need different settings for different processes.

  The following parameters can be used to tune to the data (done by
  Gerald Rudolph on version 5.6 with and without anisotropic cluster
  decay). However, tunings to versions 5.8 and earlier are not necessarily
  applicable to this version.
  - QCDLAM (Lambda-QCD, default value 0.18 GeV): Can be identified
    with Lambda-MSbar but only at high momentum fractions (x or z).
  - RMASS(13) (effective gluon mass, default value 0.75 GeV)
  - CLMAX maximum allowed mass of a cluster made from 2 quarks (default
    value 3.35)
  - VQCUT a cutoff added to quark masses in the parton showers to avoid
    divergences (default 0.48)
  - VGCUT as above added to gluon masses (default 0.10)
  - VPCUT the analogous quantity for photon emission, the default is
    root(s) - no emission; data indicate it is insensitive to its exact
    value in the range 0.1-1.0 .
  The following parameters have made available to provide additional
  possibilities to tune to the data. They are all relative
  normalised weights (defaults = 1.).
  - SNGWT production of singlet baryons in fragmentation
  - DECWT production of decuplet baryons in fragmentation
  - VECWT production of vector mesons in fragmentation
  - TENWT production of tensor mesons in fragmentation
  - PWT(i) i=1,7 weights for d,u,s,c,b,t and diquarks in that order

  An interface to DYMU3 has been added to provide the initial process
  including initial state radiation but not final state. Electroweak
  parameters are taken from the HERWIG values. To use set the IHARD
  parameter on the GENE card to 3.

  More information about HERWIG itself can be found in the references, in
   particular ref 3.5 describes version 5.4 .

  A bug ( non conservation of isospin symetry) has been found and fixed by
  G.Rudolph in April-May 1999. A possible tuning of fragmentation parameters,
  different for light ( udsc) and heavy (b) quarks has been set up ( see GBFR
  data card). A wrong mixing angle between eta/eta' has been fixed as well.
  Finally, the usage and scale of the VMIN2 variable has been fixed also in
  November 99 ( usage) and scale (January 2000).

6. comments   : 
 -    In case one uses gamma gamma processes, user should be aware of possible
 high inefficiency depending on the values of initial parameters. However the
 cross section applies to the phase space asked for and the luminosity should
 be worked out using the events asked for....
    In case one wants to use PDF library, add the additionnal library 
  $2$DKB300:[CERN_A.PRO.LIB]PDFLIB.OLB   on VMS
  /cern/pro/lib/libpdflib.a              on unix
    Be carefull with the gamma gamma option, user will have to use the MAXREC
  parameter on the GHRW card to obtain the requested number of events.
 - since Aleph version 104 of the interface, the B0 mixing is handle in a more appropriate
 way : reset of the primary vertex time ( used to compute the time dependent decay length)
 and generation of a single detached vertex

 all MSTJ,PARJ,PMAi..... usual data card are available as well

5. header informations :
 5.1 run header
   Parameter bank 'KPAR' contains 13 real*4 values corresponding to :
  IFL, ECMS,IPROC,SVRT(1:3),MODE,XVRT(3),SXVRT(3).
   Integer values are stored as real; SVRT corresponds to the smearing of
   the vertex position (in cm),XVRT to the offset and SXVRT to its spread.
   MODE is the name of the initial state producer ( JETSET,PYTHIA,LEPTO).

 5.2 event header
   Process identifier IDPR = Flavor code of the generated event(1 digit
per qqbar flavor ).
In case of mixed flavor run, the event is analysed to give in this word
the flavor generated (the second flavor generated in the event appears
as the lowest decimal digit, that is 21 means ddbar quarks plus a uubar
pair).

   Weight :can be ignored as all events have weight 1.

   Center of mass energy ECMS = as defined by the user in the Data card.

6. comments   :  The tuning of this generator to Aleph data have been
 established by Gerald Rudolph. Values are given in the example data cards.
 Fragmentation parameters have changed wrt the values used in
 the standard JETSET 7.4 option.

1. code I.D.  : original version (KORALW 1.31) by Skrzypek,Jadach,Placzek,Was;
                extension of KORALW1.02 (interfaced by P.Perez and B.Bloch as
                KRLW01) to include 4-f bkg diagrams via GRACEv2.0 package;
                KRLW03 is an upgrade on KRLW02
                transmitted in September 1997 by S. Jezequel;
                interfaced by S. Jezequel;
                contact people: S.Jezequel;

2. write-up   :
 
  Main features of KORALW version 1.31 / NEW features w.r.t. KORALW 1.21
  -Multiple soft ISR photons with FINITE transverse momenta
   generated according to YFS Monte Carlo technique.
  -Massive kinematics for all particles.
  -Massless Internal Born (CC3) matrix element.
  -Anomalous WWV couplings in internal (CC3) matrix el.
        Convention of K. Hagiwara, R.D. Peccei, D. Zeppenfeld and K. Hikasa,
                      Nucl. Phys. B282 (1987) 253.
  -Coulomb effect included
  -Interface to Grace v. 2.0 package for all W decay channels
        (interface to any other external matrix element is also possible).
        Gluon diagrams (eg. in uudd) are included in the code but switched off
        (hard-wired).
        Higgs diagrams are included in the code and switched on (hard-wired).
        The electron-Higgs couplings are neglected.
        External matrix element needs fixed W and Z widths; be aware of the
        corresponding mass shifts!
  -NEW : All four fermions final states are included ( e+e-e+e-,...)
  -Optional presampler for more complicated  than just WW breit wigner
        enhancements over phase space in unweighted event generation.
  -Matrix element with QED second order LL initial state radiation.
  -All final state configurations according to branching ratios.
   Branching ratios are either Born or corrected for CKM and QCD effects
   (for hard-wired values of CKM matrix and alphaQCD).
   Internal CC3 approximation is used in CKM non-diagonal W-decays even if
   external matrix element is turned on.
  -Interface to TAUOLA, PHOTOS and JETSET
  -String connection in JETSET in WW/ZZ hadronic final states (eg. uudd)
        follows WW or ZZ configuration with probabilities proportional to
        the matrix element squared for WW or ZZ diagrams.
  -Semianalytical routine KORWAN is included in the package (CC3 only).
  -KORALW was tested against semianalytical results of KORWAN (CC3 only),
   and the technical precision on total cross section (with and without
   photons) was found to be of order 1d-4 or better in the LEP2 energy range
   but KORWAN not OK for full 4 fermion computation in KORALW1.31
  -NEW : No angular cut needed for WW final state
  -NEW : Variables of the banks FZFR(hadronisation of heavy quarks)
         and KXME(CC03 and 4f weights) are stored

  Main limitations of KORALW version 1.31
  - no anomalous WWV couplings in external GRACE 4-fermion matrix element
  - QED corrections only in Initial State or in W decay
  - no 'color reconnection'

6. comments   :

   Additionnal libaries needed are : GRACE200,TAUOLA,PHOTOS,JETSET7.4 and
   its block data . If one uses the .opt file , all this is done for you !
                                                                              
   With setting KeySmp = MOD(KeyTek,1000)/100=1 multiple channel 4-body phase
   space is getting activated. This is necessary if one want to generate
   events accordingly to matrix element strongly peaked in other regions of
   phase space than just regions enhanced by two WW breit-wigners. For this
   purpose the same technique as described in TAUOLA paper [Comp. Phys. Commun.
   76 (1993) 361] was used. See there, formula (20) and related explanations.
   In short an algorithm splits and accordingly to predefined probabilities
   phase space point is generated accordingly to one of algorithm branches.
   Finally an overall phase-space weight is calculated as a probability
   weighted (inverse harmonic) average of weights for all generation branches.
   So far the following branches have been introduced, which are now combined
   with probabilities 0.3, 0.1, 0.2, 0.2, 0.1, 0.1 respectively:
   1)  Old like in koralw 1.02 WW generation  channel in invariant masses of:
       (1+2) (3+4) pairs from final state 4-fermion states.
       In this case there is a lot of events generated if invariant
       mass of a pair of first and second fermion and third and fourth
       fermion are close to W mass. These events have however vey small
       phase space weight which will cancel peaks in matrix
       element in an overall weight. Making overall weight relatively flat.
       We will call it, and similarily in other cases below, as:
       (W)(W) enhancement channel in in (1+2) (3+4) final state fermion pairs.
       Analogously: (Z)     denotes enhancement for Z propagator
                    (gamma) enhancement for photon exchange propagator (peak at
                            small invariant mass)
                    (flat)  just flat distribution in the given invariant mass
                            squared.
       These are in cases below sometimes  combined, so far with equal
       probabilities; no optimalization.
   2)  No enhancement channel
   3)  (Z+flat+gamma)(Z+flat+gamma) enhancement channel
       in (1+4) (2+3) final state fermion pairs.
   4)  (W+flat+gamma)(W+flat+gamma) enhancement channel
       in (1+2) (3+4) final state fermion pairs. With additional collinear
       singularity enhancement for final state fermions nr 1 and 4 collinear
       with the beam.
   5)  (Z+flat+gamma)(Z+flat+gamma) enhancement channel.
       in (1+4) (2+3) final state fermion pairs. With additional collinear
       singularity  enhancementfor final state fermions nr 1 and 3 collinear
       with the beam.
   6)  (Z+flat+gamma)(Z+flat+gamma) enhancement channel
       in (1+4) (2+3) final state fermion pairs. With additional collinear
       singularity  enhancement for final state fermions nr 2 and 4 collinear
       with the beam.

   For the purpose of LEP 2 physics the authors find the speed not to be a
   major problem anyway. That is why they did not came through the painful
   (work requiring) tuning of the presampler parameters (see the above branch
   probabilities) as a function of center of mass energy and particular
   generated final state flavours.

   In KRLW03, the above primary cuts are replaced by user cuts defined
   through the cards GCE0.
   Card GCE0 provides cuts which need care when changing.
   CMIN and CMAX are very general ( acceptance cut).
   The main problem of generation comes from the channels
   e+e- charge+charge- because of the gamma-gamma singularities.
   The following cuts intend to supress these singularities.
   SPT2EE removes events with ISR of strong Pt. SPT2 cuts
   on the sum of the Pt^2 of the four fermions. SCUT asks
   for high sum of invariant masses of fermions; in case of
   e+e-e+e-, SCUTEE cuts on the sum of the combination on pairs
   (with respect to SCUT).

   The maximum weights are differents for CC03, only WW and
   all 4 fermions. The author advices :
      CC03  : 6.E5
      WW    : 2.E6
      all 4f: 5.E7

                interfaced in September 1991
                contact person: P. Janot,B. Bloch

2. write-up   :
   ZNNB01 is a Monte Carlo generator for WW fusion into a Z boson leading
   to a Z nu nubar final state. It includes initial state radiation with
   the REMT package. Note that the differential cross-section available
   in the litterature is integrated over the final state neutrino variables,
   which makes impossible to simulate their four-momenta. For this reason,
   their px,py,pz,E are set to zero in the generated particle list. (This
   is of no practical consequence since the neutrinos generally do not
   interact with ALEPH (!) irrespective of their momenta.)

   upgrades in January 2001 :
   - fixes to be Linux compatible :missing type declaration in DISTRYPT
                                   bad type argument of RNDM in DSIGMA
                                   bad type argument of DGAUSS in ZNNBSI

   - new routine UGTSEC to create cross-section bank KSEC
   - 2nd random number sequence used for Z decay and hadronisation
   - IDPR is now Z decay mode ( see below)
   - control histogram of Z decay modes
   - analysis of event particle content

    This is the new di-fermion Monte-Carlo generator of Jadach et al.
    Main improvements w.r.t KORALZ are the inclusion of the ISR/FSR QED
    interference (2% change on the cross section), inclusion of the exact
    matrix element for 2 photons and inclusion of the tranverse spin
    correlations in tau decays).
    This MC can be used for u,d,s,c,b,tau,mu flavors.
    Bhabha, neutrino and top quark final states are not included.
    The ISR and FSR cannot be switched off at the same time.

    *************

1. code I.D.  : original version  HERWIG 6.2 from  B.Webber et al.
                interfaced in 2000 by B.Bloch-Devaux 
                contact people : G.Rudolph and B.Bloch.


2. write-up   :
  The HERWIG (Hadron Emission Reactions With Interfering Gluons)Monte-Carlo
   event generator was written by G. Marchesini and B.R. Webber. It is
   designed to simulate high energy hadronic processes with particular
   emphasis on QCD parton showers.
  Many improvements have been introduced in version 6 with respect to version 5.9.

  A full documentation can be found at :
     http://hepwww.rl.ac.uk/theory/seymour/herwig/

  and a special documentation on the latest developments to implement the Hard Matrrix
  element option in WW and ZZ events can be found as :
     http://hepwww.rl.ac.uk/theory/seymour/herwig/wwme.html


  A flavor dependent cluster fragmentation parameters implementation is now available 
 on a standard basis :variables PSPLT, CLDIR,CLSMR are now dimension(2) for light (udsc)
 and heavy(b) clusters.

 The opportunity was taken to rearrange the data cards for an easier usage ....

6. comments   :
 -    In case one uses gamma gamma processes, user should be aware of possible
 high inefficiency depending on the values of initial parameters. However the
 cross section applies to the phase space asked for and the luminosity should
 be worked out using the events asked for....

1. code I.D.  : KK2F version 4.14 from S. Jadach et al.
                interfaced by B. Bloch december 2000
                contact people : B. Bloch-Devaux.

2. write-up   :
    this is the version 4.14
    a helpful document can be found in :
                 http://home.cern.ch/~jadach/

    This is the new di-fermion Monte-Carlo generator of Jadach et al.
    Main improvements w.r.t KORALZ are the inclusion of the ISR/FSR QED
    interference (2% change on the cross section), inclusion of the exact
    matrix element for 2 photons and inclusion of the tranverse spin
    correlations in tau decays).
    This MC can be used for u,d,s,c,b,tau,mu flavors.
    Bhabha, neutrino and top quark final states are not included.
    The ISR and FSR cannot be switched off at the same time.

    Compared to previous version, upgrades/fixes are :

  - In-line initialization of Dizet in case of quark mixture generation
  - centralized access to all weights
  - improved QCD FSR, QCDCOR of Dizet implemented through gv and ga
  - virtual pairs for initial/final state added as alternative weights ( Wtlist(213,263))

    this is the version 4.15d
    a helpful document can be found in :
                 http://home.cern.ch/~jadach/

    This is the new di-fermion Monte-Carlo generator of Jadach et al.
    Main improvements w.r.t previous version 4.14 is the inclusion of
    neutrino final states, nu nubar + zero/one/more gammas .

     Warning : for technical reasons, one should switch on INTerference term
     and switch off FSR  to get the correct average number of photons !

     In addition for some special topologies ( at least one photon above Emin
     an the detector angular acceptance), some anomalous coupling calculations
     are available as in KORL09 :
    the nu nubar gamma (gamma) final state, including or not the anomalous couplings
    Delta(kappa) and Lambda used in the description of the S.M. Anomalous W W gamma couplings
    is simulated. The effects of the anomalous couplings are stored as 6 weights 
    for each event in a bank, KWTK, which is added to the event kinematics banks 
    and transmitted through all ALEPH packages up to the MINIs. See the definition 
    of the KWTK elements using 'sbank'.

  The reference below should be carefully read before using this generator, especially
  if one wishes to use the six event weights in the the nu nubar gamma (gamma) final state.

1. code I.D.  : original version ( GGFF ) from A. Courau - Orsay;
                transmitted in May 1988 by G. Bonneaud;
                interfaced by B. Bloch with contributions from E. Lange;
                contact people : B. Bloch-Devaux.
 
2. write-up   :
  It is a two-photons annihilation generator written by A. Courau, Orsay,
in December 1983 and Spring 1988. It calculates the process
                  e+ e- ---> e+ e- gamma gamma ---> f+ f-
where f may be an electron, a muon, a tau ( subsequently decayed) or any
quark (subsequently hadronised).
  It may be used for untagged, antitagged or single tagged experiments at
e+e-  colliders.
 
   This program has the following facilities:
 2.1 it generates a final state which might be a pair of:
  - electron or muon,
  - Taus which is then decayed using Lund and an updated version of the
    decay routines and branching ratios (ALEPH July 1988),
  - single flavor quark pair which is then hadronised using Lund,
  - mixed flavor events, each flavor frequency being proportionnal to the
    corresponding cross-section.
 2.2 it generates the fermion pair
  - within a given angular acceptance in the lab,
  - within a given invariant mass range,
  - according to a given e+e- Luminosity,
  - according to a given number of events (usual mode),
  - according to a given CPU time (not available).
 2.3 it allows specific configurations selection (which saves time) with
enough statistics :
  - to study gamma-gamma events ( selecting dominant part),
  - to study gamma-gamma distribution tails as background for other
processes.
 2.4 it gives for each event the corresponding luminosity reached since
the beginning of the run.
 2.5 it prints at the end of run the real number of events and the
corresponding luminosity.
 
   Requirements :
  - both created fermions must be either within the angular acceptance
(at least for 2-body) or within 4*PI (for unstable fermions),
  - both scattered electrons must be outside the angular acceptance, and
possibly, in addition, either both outside an anti-tagging angular range
or at leat one within a tagging angular range.
  - the angular acceptance must be symetrical (| Cos(TETA)|<UZERO )

4. data cards :
   No generator data cards is mandatory but two cards ( GENE and GCUT )
may be introduced to supersede default values :
 
* ALUM   : e+e- Luminosity in picobarn-1;
* NTYP   : Type of generated fermions  1 = electrons,

6. comments   :
 6.1 The cuts on acceptance must be set in the MONTE CARLO generator less
drastically than in the analysis later on, as the resolution of the
detector will enter as a smearing factor.
 
 6.2 The program has been corrected for several bugs found in the origi-
nal code, and reorganised in a more modular way.Users are encouraged to
play with the program to check its validity. Please, report any problem,
suggestion, improvement.... to B. Bloch (BBLOCH@CERNVM or VXCERN::BLOCH).
 
 6.3 In case of tau production, it is possible to use the up-to-date
    branching ratios and decay modes as defined by the Tau group.Just
    answer(Y)when asked in the Panel if you need the modified Lund
    routines.
 
 6.4 It is possible to modify some values of Lund parameters,particularly
    the fragmentation scheme .  See the LUND02 section for a complete

1. code I.D.  : original versions (MUMU0/MUMU1,LUM0,LUM1...) written
                by S.Kawabata (  now  at  KEK).   Based  on  earlier
                program  by  J.A.M.Vermasseren.Later developments also by
                J.Olsson,H.Wriedt, and J.M.Nye of JADE.

                interfaced from December 1988 to April 1989;
                contact people :  A.Finch
 
2. write-up   :
 
       This program enables the user to generate events of the type
                         e+ e- -> e+ e- X,
where X can be either a multihadronic state generated according to the
VDM  process,  or  a  pair  of leptons generated according to the QED
process, or a single resonance.
 
       The program is based on a set of  programs  originally  developed
for the PETRA experiments by Dr S.Kawabata, and used extensively there.
The basis of the Monte Carlo integration is a pair of routines called
BASES and SPRING (ref 3.4).BASES is a routine that performs stratified
sampling of a function in up to 10 dimensions.It works by dividing up
the integration space into a series of hypercubes and then repeatedly
samples the function over all the available space and builds up a 'Map'
of the function.It then uses this map to sample the function again,
attempting to improve the efficiency of the integration  by  adjusting
the dimensions of the hypercubes.When a satisfactory map is obtained(this
typically takes several tens of minutes of CPU )the map is saved on a
disk file.The next program 'SPRING' reads the Map back in and uses it
to generate unit weight events.This program is very fast and can easily
produce several thousand events per minute of CPU (if they are not being
fragmented ).In order to obtain different samples of events , use the
standard procedure for RANMAR initialisation (see RANMAR section).
 
      The physics of the process  is  contained  in  a  function  F(X) .
Several different F(X) were developed at PETRA for different two photon
processes.I have simply combined them in one routine with suitable
switches so that they can be used by non-experts.The three main processes
implemented so far are
 
        a) lepton pairs via QED
        b) hadrons via the VDM process
        c) narrow pseudoscalar resonances
        d) broad  tensor resonances
 
 2.1 Physics processes
 
   a) QED
      This is the Kawabata version of the QED program by J.A.M.Vermaseren
 (ref 3.2).It is an exact QED calculation of the process e+ e- -> e+ e-
  l+ l- , where l+ l- is a pair  of  charged  fermions  of  equal mass.
 
   b) VDM
      In this program the VDM process is simulated where the e+e- cross
 section is given by the formula:
 
        sigma = (A+B/W) .  L .  F(q1,q2)
         e+e-
 
      where A is typically expected to be 300 nb and B is 270  nb.
 
      F(q1,q2) is the VDM Form Function according to Ginzburg & Serbo,
 PHYS.  LETT.  109B(1982), NO.3, P.231FF, EQ.(2)
 
                         F(q1,q2) = f(q1)*f(q2)
 
  f(q) = 0.65g(q,0.591) + 0.08g(q,0.612) + 0.05g(q,1.04)
                                                  + 0.22/(1+q**2/1.96)
 
                                            1+0.25(q**2/x)
                            where g(q,x) =  --------------
                                            (1+q**2/x)**2
 
   and L is the luminosity function ( ref 3.1)
      The program prints out a line , something like :
 
   LUMINOSITY FUNCTION FOR THIS PROCESS = xxx
 
 So typically one would multiply xxx by 300 to obtain a cross section
 in nanobarns.  In general the 1/W term can be neglected for invariant
 masses above 3 GeV
 
   c) Pseudoscalar generation
      In this case the same luminosity function routine as above is used
 at a fixed mass of the particle being generated ( At present Pi0,Eta,
 Etab and Etac are available).In addition the following q**2 dependance
 is applied:
 
       Wtt(s,q1**2,q2**2) = 0.5PI(v**2-m**2Q**2).F**2(q1**2,q2**2)
 
     where Q = 0.5(q1-q2), v = Q(q1+q2), and m = mass of resonance
 
      and F is the rho form factor -
 
 
 
 
                          F = f(q1)*f(q2) and f(q) = (1-q**2/MR**2)-1
                             MR = mass(rho)
 
      In the literature, results in this field are discussed in terms
    of the radiative width of the resonance . To convert a radiative
    width into a cross section, one uses the formula:
 
        sigma = 8 * PI**2 * (Radiative width) * 0.389 * L
                ---------
                M**2*4Eb
 
 The program calculates the product of all these terms,thus one only
 needs  to  multiply  the  number it gives times one's chosen radiative
 width to give a cross section. It prints out a statement something like-
 
 TOTAL CROSS SECTION FOR THIS PROCESS = xxx TIMES ( GAMMA GAMMA PARTIAL
  WIDTH IN GEV ) IN MICROBARNS .
 
 Where xxx is the calculated value of
 
               8 * PI**2 *  0.389 * L
                ---------
                M**2*4Eb
 
 
 Suitable values for the radiative widths
 of pseudoscalars are (3.6) :
 
     Resonance                      Radiative Width  (KeV)
 
        Pi0                              0.0075 +/- 0.0003
        Eta                              0.52   +/- 0.03
        Eta prime                        4.30   +/- 0.25
        Etac                             6      +/- 3
        Etab                             0.4 (theoretical)
 d) Broad Resonance Production.
 
   Currently the only example of this class is the f2(1270).
 
      In this case, instead of a fixed mass, the mass is chosen from a
 Breit Wigner distribution. The luminosity function is then calculated,
 and a Rho form factor is applied. The integration is limited to the
 range  Nominal Mass +- 3*GAMTOT.
 
      Radiative widths of tensor mesons(3.6):
 
     Resonance         Radiative Width (KeV)     Total Width (GAMTOT)
      f2(1270)         3.1 +/- 0.2 +/- 0.3        0.178 GeV
      a2(1320)         0.97 +/- 0.12
 
 2.2 Fragmentation
 
   In most cases the fragmentation and/or decay of the particles produced
 by SPRING is handled by LUND routines.In the case of the QED,and Pseudo-
 scalars this is straightforward.In the case of VDM,SPRING produces a
 resonance with a mass W,where W is sampled according to the chosen W
 dependance.This 'resonance' is transformed by the program into two
 quarks initially aligned along the gamma gamma direction (in the gamma
 gamma CMS ).The quarks are then given some equal and opposite Pt with
 respect  to  the gamma gamma direction according to the formula
 
                       dsigma/dPt**2 = exp-(Pt_vdm.pt**2)
 
    where Pt_vdm is a parameter that can be set on the GVDM card.
    In the case of the f2(1270) a special routine decays it into
  either pi0 pi0,pi+ pi-,k+ k-,or 4 pi, in the ratios
   31.1 : 62.1 : 3.6 : 3.2. A helicity 2 distribution is assumed.
 
3. references :
 3.1  The  luminosity  function  used  in  the  VDM  and   Pseudoscalar
 generators derives from Formulae (28) and (29d) in Bonneau,Gourdin and
 Martin, NP B54 (1973) 573.  the variables are coded as  given  in  the
 approximative formula (9),J.  Field, NP B168(1980) 477,and erratum, NP
 B176(1980) 545.Note however that the Q**2  approximation  as  used  by
 Field  is  not  applied in the code.  The calculations of this program
 differ by 8 % from the calculations made by J.Field.  this is  due  to
 the  fact  that  Field's  calculations  are made by using the explicit
 functions f1,f2 and f3, which  are  reformulations  of  the  functions
 given in appendix 2 of Bonneau et al.The latter functions are obtained
 from formula (41) in that  ref.,  and  contain  a  Q**2  approximation
 (explicitly  stated  in  the  text).  This is not done in the Kawabata
 code, and his integration value should be more correct to use.
 
 3.2  The so called QED processes  use  a  program  written  by  J.A.M.
 Vermasseren   described  in  his  contribution  to  the  International
 Workshop on Gamma Gamma Interactions, Amiens,April 1980, published  by
 Springer Verlag ( Editors G.Cochard, and P.Kessler), and Bhattacharya,
 Smith, and Grammer, PR D15(1977) p 3267, and a long program  write  up
 by J.A.M.  Vermasseren (unpubl.)
 
 3.3  The pseudoscalar generator uses in addition the pseudoscalar form
 factors derived from Koepp, Walsh and Zerwas NP B 70(1974) 461-485
 
 3.4  The programs BASES, and SPRING writen by S.Kawabata are described
 briefly  in  a  contribution  to  the  parallel  sessions, reported by
 J.H.Field in Proc.  IVth  International  Colloquium  on  Photon-Photon
 Interactions  (  Paris  1981) p447.  A later version of the program is
 described in Comp.  Phys.  Commun.  41 (1986) 127.
 
 3.5 The Breit Wigner formula used includes a 'barrier penetration
 formula' according to J.M.Blatt dn V.F.Weisskopf, Theoretical  Nuclear
 Physics, Wiley Publication ( New York: John Wiley and  Sons 1952) pp.
 359-365 and pp. 386-389.
 
 3.6  Values for the radiative widths of measured pseudscalars are taken
 from Table 2, on page 8 of 'Meson Production in Two-Photon Collisions',
 MIT-LNS-169 march 1988. ( Submitted to Annual Reviews of Nuclear and
 Particle Physics). The value for the f2 is taken from table 5 on page
 15 of the same publication. The theoretical value for the Etab can be
 obtained using  formula 16.13 on page 356 of F.E.Close's book An
 Introduction to Quarks and Partons (Academic Press 1979), substituting
 in the value for the Upsilon leptonic width.
 
4. data cards :
   No generator data card is mandatory but five cards may be introduced
to supersede default values : GCON,GVDM,GCUT,GQPM,GPSH
   An extra card GMAP allow the user to give a file name for the map
to be written out or read in by the program.
   The most important card is GCON. On this card items that most
 often need to be changed are :
 
    ITYPE  - to pick the type of final state
    EBEAM  - Beam Energy
    WMIN   - Minimum invariant mass to be generated
    ILUN   - Whether map is to be read in or written out
 
  The GVDM card is used to control the VDM process. Note that as PTVDM
 only controls fragmentation and is not important for calculating the
 luminosity function its value on the card will override any value read
 in from a map. This means a range of different values for PTVDM can be
 used without generating new maps.
 
  The GCUT card applies geometrical cuts to the scattered electrons. Most
 users will require ' NO TAG ' events which is the default.
 
  Users wishing to apply more sophisticated cuts to the final state
 particles are encouraged to link in their own version of AMCSEL, see
 note 6.4 below.
* ILUN  0 :a map will written out to file (name in GMAP card)
*       1 :a map will be read from file (name in GMAP card)
*  When a map is read in , all variables controlling the physics which
*  may have been set by another card are overwritten. This ensures that
*  events are generated with the same conditions as  used in  the  map
*  generation  step.Failure to do so would produce erroneous results.
*  When  generating the map do not ask for events at the same time,
*  better do it in the second step when reading the map back.
* IHIS   1 (ON) or 0 (OFF),if 'ON'then histograms are booked and filled.
* ITYPE    type of physics process choosen with following convention:

5. Header informations :
 5.1 run header
   Parameter bank 'KPAR' contains 17 real*4 values corresponding to :
 
   TAB(1) = FLOAT(ITYPE)         TAB(11) = AMASS
   TAB(2) = EBEAM                TAB(12) = PTCUT

   TAB(9) = TMAX
   TAB(10) = XSECT Cross section or Luminosity function
 
 5.2 event header
   Process identifier IDPR = ITYPE of final state ( in case of mixed u-d
    quark generation,the event is tagged as 11 (u quark) or 12 (d quark))
 
   Weight :  can be ignored by user as all events have weight = 1.
 
   Center of mass energy ECMS = 2.*EBEAM.
 
6. Comments   :
 6.1  Note that in the case of the QED  processes  the  result  of  the
 integral  by  BASES  is  a  cross section , but in the case of VDM and
 Pseudoscalar generation the number is a Luminosity function.  A  cross
 section is obtained by plugging this number into the relevant formula.
 ( see sections 2.1 (b), and (c) above. )
 In the case of quarks , the cross section includes the correct  colour
 and  charge factors.  The program writes a ( hopefully ) clear message
 explaining what is required to obtain a cross section  in  each  case.
 The relevant value is stored in KPAR as described above.
 6.2 The mass of the object X or fermion in the final state is taken from
 the Lund common and can be modified by a PMAS card ( see LUND02 doc).
 Subsequent fragmentation or decay will be done by Lund.Lund parameters
 can be modified by external data cards .The modified Lund scheme for
 tau decays may be used by requiring the use of modified Lund routines
 in the exec file KINRUN.
 6.3  If WMIN is found to be too low by the program for the particular
 process being generated it will be reset to a suitable value ,with an
 appropriate warning.For example it is not sensible to try to produce
 a pair of c quarks with a WMIN < 2* c-quark mass.
 6.4  A user subroutine AMCSEL (KEEP) has been introduced for users who
 want to reject some events before they are written out. If logical KEEP
 is TRUE , event is kept, if FALSE discarded. This is called after the
 fragmentation step has been called so all information about the event
 can be obtained from the LUND commons.
 6.5  Users should be aware that in two cases:
      1) Use of AMCSEL to reject events
      2) Errors from MCGVDM due to low mass VDM events.
 events may not be written out. In all cases the event number  will be
 incremented however. The luminosity function, or cross  section
 calculated by BASES clearly can not take this rejection  into account so
 in order to calculate the effective luminosity that has been generated
 one should use the event number, not the number of events in the final
 dataset!

    *************
 
1. code I.D.  : original versions (MUMU0/MUMU1,LUM0,LUM1...) written
                by S.Kawabata (  now  at  KEK).   Based  on  earlier
                program  by  J.A.M.Vermasseren.Later developments also by
                J.Olsson,H.Wriedt, and J.M.Nye of JADE.
                transmitted in August 1988 as PHOT01;
                interfaced to JETSET7.3 (as PHOT02) February 1993;
                contact people :  A.Finch
 
2. write-up   :
 
       This program enables the user to generate events of the type
                         e+ e- -> e+ e- X,
where X can be either a multihadronic state generated according to the
VDM  process,  or  a  pair  of leptons generated according to the QED
process, or a single resonance.
 
       The program is based on a set of  programs  originally  developed
for the PETRA experiments by Dr S.Kawabata, and used extensively there.
The basis of the Monte Carlo integration is a pair of routines called
BASES and SPRING (ref 3.4).BASES is a routine that performs stratified
sampling of a function in up to 10 dimensions.It works by dividing up
the integration space into a series of hypercubes and then repeatedly
samples the function over all the available space and builds up a 'Map'
of the function.It then uses this map to sample the function again,
attempting to improve the efficiency of the integration  by  adjusting
the dimensions of the hypercubes.When a satisfactory map is obtained(this
typically takes several tens of minutes of CPU )the map is saved on a
disk file.The next program 'SPRING' reads the Map back in and uses it
to generate unit weight events.This program is very fast and can easily
produce several thousand events per minute of CPU (if they are not being
fragmented ).In order to obtain different samples of events , use the
standard procedure for RANMAR initialisation (see RANMAR section).
 The behaviour of the integration package is controlled by the GBAS
card.
 
      The physics of the process  is  contained  in  a  function  F(X) .
Several different F(X) were developed at PETRA for different two photon
processes.I have simply combined them in one routine with suitable
switches so that they can be used by non-experts.The four main processes
implemented so far are
 
        a) lepton pairs via QED ( including QPM )
        b) hadrons via the VDM process
        c) narrow pseudoscalar resonances
        d) broad  tensor resonances
 
 2.1 Physics processes
 
   a) QED
      This is the Kawabata version of the QED program by J.A.M.Vermaseren
 (ref 3.2).It is an exact QED calculation of the process e+ e- -> e+ e-
  l+ l- , where l+ l- is a pair  of  charged  fermions  of  equal mass.
 
   b) VDM
      In this program the VDM process is simulated where the e+e- cross
 section is given by the formula:
 
        sigma = (A+B/W) .  L .  F(q1,q2)
         e+e-
 
      where A is typically expected to be 300 nb and B is 270  nb.
 
      F(q1,q2) is the VDM Form Function according to Ginzburg & Serbo,
 PHYS.  LETT.  109B(1982), NO.3, P.231FF, EQ.(2)
 
                         F(q1,q2) = f(q1)*f(q2)
 
  f(q) = 0.65g(q,0.591) + 0.08g(q,0.612) + 0.05g(q,1.04)
                                                  + 0.22/(1+q**2/1.96)
 
                                            1+0.25(q**2/x)
                            where g(q,x) =  --------------
                                            (1+q**2/x)**2
 
   and L is the luminosity function ( ref 3.1)
 
   In order to simulate VDM one then needs to simulate both the
    constant and 1/W terms. These require seperate runs of the
    generator. In this case the program does not produce a cross section
    but a 'luminosity function'. This is a number that converts a
     gamma gamma -> X cross section into an e+e-->e+e- X cross section.
     At some point then the program prints out a line , something like :
 
   LUMINOSITY FUNCTION FOR THIS PROCESS = xxx
 
   So if one believes the VDM cross section is 100 nb one would multiply
 xxx by 100 to obtain a cross section  in nanobarns. In 1993 the best fit
 to Aleph data is obtained with a constant term (A) of 100nb, and a 1/w
 term B of 1000 nb GeV/c**2.
 
   c) Pseudoscalar generation
      In this case the same luminosity function routine as above is used
 at a fixed mass of the particle being generated ( At present Pi0,Eta,
 Etab and Etac are available).In addition the following q**2 dependance
 is applied:
 
       Wtt(s,q1**2,q2**2) = 0.5PI(v**2-m**2Q**2).F**2(q1**2,q2**2)
 
     where Q = 0.5(q1-q2), v = Q(q1+q2), and m = mass of resonance
 
      and F is the rho form factor -
 
 
 
 
                          F = f(q1)*f(q2) and f(q) = (1-q**2/MR**2)-1
                             MR = mass(rho)
 
      In the literature, results in this field are discussed in terms
    of the radiative width of the resonance . To convert a radiative
    width into a cross section, one uses the formula:
 
        sigma = 8 * PI**2 * (Radiative width) * 0.389 * L
                ---------
                M**2*4Eb
 
 The program calculates the product of all these terms,thus one only
 needs  to  multiply  the  number it gives times one's chosen radiative
 width to give a cross section. It prints out a statement something like-
 
 TOTAL CROSS SECTION FOR THIS PROCESS = xxx TIMES ( GAMMA GAMMA PARTIAL
  WIDTH IN GEV ) IN MICROBARNS .
 
 Where xxx is the calculated value of
 
               8 * PI**2 *  0.389 * L
                ---------
                M**2*4Eb
 
 
 Suitable values for the radiative widths
 of pseudoscalars are (3.6) :
 
     Resonance                      Radiative Width  (KeV)
 
        Pi0                              0.0075 +/- 0.0003
        Eta                              0.52   +/- 0.03
        Eta prime                        4.30   +/- 0.25
        Etac                             6      +/- 3
        Etab                             0.4 (theoretical)
 d) Broad Resonance Production.
 
   Currently the only example of this class is the f2(1270).
 
      In this case, instead of a fixed mass, the mass is chosen from a
 Breit Wigner distribution. The luminosity function is then calculated,
 and a Rho form factor is applied. The integration is limited to the
 range  Nominal Mass +- 3*GAMTOT.
 
      Radiative widths of tensor mesons(3.6):
 
     Resonance         Radiative Width (KeV)     Total Width (GAMTOT)
      f2(1270)         3.1 +/- 0.2 +/- 0.3        0.178 GeV
      a2(1320)         0.97 +/- 0.12
 
 2.2 Fragmentation
 
   In all cases the fragmentation and/or decay of the particles produced
 by SPRING is handled by LUND routines.In the case of the QED,and Pseudo-
 scalars this is straightforward.In the case of VDM,SPRING produces a
 'resonance' with a mass W,where W is sampled according to the chosen W
 dependance.This 'resonance' is transformed by the program into either
 two or four  quarks. The former case is referred to as the PLUTO scheme
  whereas the latter is referred to as the RHORHO model. The user can
 choose which scheme he prefers. In both cases the user can control the
 pt of the quarks with respect to the gamma gamma direction (in the gamma
 gamma CMS ) via the parameter Pt_VDM. The quarks are given some  Pt with
 respect  to  the gamma gamma direction according to the formula
 
                       dsigma/dPt**2 = exp-(Pt_vdm.pt**2)
 
    where Pt_vdm is a parameter that can be set on the GVDM card.
 
  The user is able to control many aspects of the LUND fragmentation via
 the cards, the same scheme is used here as for the generators using
 JETSET73 fragmentation ( see HVFL03 and LUND03 sections on Data cards)
 
3. references :
 3.1  The  luminosity  function  used  in  the  VDM  and   Pseudoscalar
 generators derives from Formulae (28) and (29d) in Bonneau,Gourdin and
 Martin, NP B54 (1973) 573.  the variables are coded as  given  in  the
 approximative formula (9),J.  Field, NP B168(1980) 477,and erratum, NP
 B176(1980) 545.Note however that the Q**2  approximation  as  used  by
 Field  is  not  applied in the code.  The calculations of this program
 differ by 8 % from the calculations made by J.Field.  this is  due  to
 the  fact  that  Field's  calculations  are made by using the explicit
 functions f1,f2 and f3, which  are  reformulations  of  the  functions
 given in appendix 2 of Bonneau et al.The latter functions are obtained
 from formula (41) in that  ref.,  and  contain  a  Q**2  approximation
 (explicitly  stated  in  the  text).  This is not done in the Kawabata
 code, and his integration value should be more correct to use.

 3.6  Values for the radiative widths of measured pseudscalars are taken
 from Table 2, on page 8 of 'Meson Production in Two-Photon Collisions',

 Particle Physics). The value for the f2 is taken from table 5 on page
 15 of the same publication. The theoretical value for the Etab can be
 obtained using  formula 16.13 on page 356 of F.E.Close's book An
 Introduction to Quarks and Partons (Academic Press 1979), substituting
 in the value for the Upsilon leptonic width.
 
4. data cards :
   No generator data card is mandatory but five cards may be introduced
to supersede default values : GCON,GVDM,GCUT,GQED,GPSH,GBAS
   An extra card GMAP allow the user to give a file name for the map
to be written out or read in by the program.
   The most important card is GCON. On this card items that most
 often need to be changed are :
 
    ITYPE  - to pick the type of final state
    EBEAM  - Beam Energy
    WMIN   - Minimum invariant mass to be generated
    ILUN   - Whether map is to be read in or written out
 
  The GVDM card is used to control the VDM process. Note that as PTVDM
 only controls fragmentation and is not important for calculating the
 luminosity function its value on the card will override any value read
 in from a map. This means a range of different values for PTVDM can be
 used without generating new maps.
 
  The GCUT card applies geometrical cuts to the scattered electrons. Most
 users will require ' NO TAG ' events which is the default.
 
  Users wishing to apply more sophisticated cuts to the final state
 particles are encouraged to link in their own version of AMCSEL, see
 note 6.4 below.

   Cross section bank KSEC is available at the end of Run ( see definition
 in the banks section) but only in the QED option.

   Process identifier IDPR = ITYPE of final state ( in case of mixed u-d
    quark generation,the event is tagged as 11 (u quark) or 12 (d quark))
 
   Weight :  can be ignored by user as all events have weight = 1.
 
   Center of mass energy ECMS = 2.*EBEAM.
 
6. Comments   :
 6.1  Note that in the case of the QED  processes  the  result  of  the
 integral  by  BASES  is  a  cross section , but in the case of VDM and
 Pseudoscalar generation the number is a Luminosity function.  A  cross
 section is obtained by plugging this number into the relevant formula.
 ( see sections 2.1 (b), and (c) above. )
 In the case of quarks , the cross section includes the correct  colour
 and  charge factors.  The program writes a ( hopefully ) clear message
 explaining what is required to obtain a cross section  in  each  case.
 The relevant value is stored in KPAR as described above.
 6.2 The mass of the object X or fermion in the final state is taken from
 the Lund common and can be modified by a PMAS card ( see LUND02 doc).
 Subsequent fragmentation or decay will be done by Lund.Lund parameters
 can be modified by external data cards .
 6.3  If WMIN is found to be too low by the program for the particular
 process being generated it will be reset to a suitable value ,with an
 appropriate warning.For example it is not sensible to try to produce
 a pair of c quarks with a WMIN < 2* c-quark mass.
 6.4  A user subroutine AMCSEL (KEEP) has been introduced for users who
 want to reject some events before they are written out. If logical KEEP
 is TRUE , event is kept, if FALSE discarded. This is called after the
 fragmentation step has been called so all information about the event
 can be obtained from the LUND commons.
 6.5  Users should be aware that in two cases:
      1) Use of AMCSEL to reject events
      2) Errors from MCGVDM due to low mass VDM events.
 events may not be written out. In all cases the event number  will be
 incremented however. The luminosity function, or cross  section
 calculated by BASES clearly can not take this rejection  into account so
 in order to calculate the effective luminosity that has been generated
 one should use the event number, not the number of events in the final
 dataset!

6. comments   :
 
 In similar way to PHOT01/PHOT02, this program writes out a 'map' at the end
 of the initialisation step. In future runs of the program this map can be
 read back in again to produce large numbers of events quickly.

 The cross section bank KSEC is produced by the program.
 An analysis of the final multiplicity is provided at end of job

0. platforms :  AXP/VMS unix ( shift50,aloha,Linux)

1. code I.D.  : Interface to PHOJET from Ralph Engel.
                transmitted in June 1996, interfaced up to January 97
                contact people :  A.Finch
                ported to Linux : May 2001 (B.Bloch)

2. write-up   :
       This program enables the user to generate events of the type
                         e+ e- -> e+ e- X,
where X can is a multihadronic state. It is only valid for antitagged
events, i.e. the scattered electron is not seen in the detector.

 There is a separate write up available describing the program and it's
physics. It is available on the web as :
   http://alephwww.cern.ch/ALEPHGENERAL/kin/ps/phoman5-2.ps

3. references :
 See separate manual.

4. data cards :
    No generator data card is mandatory but the following are available to
 override defaults.
 PDFL to pick a different parton distribution function parameterization
 PROC to pick some subset of the 11 available subprocesses.Default is to
       provide a correct mixture of all 11
 ETG1 to define antitag region for the 1st electron
 ETG2 to define antitag region for the 2nd electron
 GCON to define the beam energy and W range to be produced
 PMDL to override model parameters in PARMDL array
 IMDL to override model parameters in ISWMDL array
 GSTD to apply some 'standard' preselection at generator level

 JETSET parameters can also be changed via PARJ etc. cards.
*
* PDFL card allows you to select a different Parton Distribution Function
*  for a given particle, defined by its Particle Data Group code.
* The meaning of IPAR,ISET,and IEXT are given in PHOJET manual and briefly 
* recalled here :
* PDFL           IDPDG IPAR ISET IEXT
* where :
* IDPDG = 22 : photon
* IPAR ISET IEXT
*  5    1    0        GRV-G LH
*  5    2    0        GRV-G HO

ETG1   20.0 0.030 3.1116
ETG2   20.0 0.030 3.1116
* If an electron has energy greater than EEMIN . and THMIN1 > Theta > THMAX
* then the event is regarded as TAGGED and the event is rejected
* ( this program only deals with ANTI-TAGGED events )

* GCON is the overall control of beam energy,and cuts on W of final

GCON    45.6 2.5

*  apply standard ALEPH selection
* isel: call standard selection 1=on/0=off
* nsav: >0 keep 1 failed event every nsav event for control, 0= keep none
* nch : select event with at least nch charged track satisfying next 2 cuts
* pcut: min momentum for charged tracks to be considered

 5.2 event header
   Process identifier IDPR = IDNODF+(10*IPROCE)

      where IDNODf,and IPROCE are defined in the program manual
   section 9.5.1

   Weight :  can be ignored by user as all events have weight = 1.

6. Comments   :
 6.1  A user subroutine AMCSEL (KEEP) has been introduced for users who
 want to reject some events before they are written out. If logical KEEP
 is TRUE , event is kept, if FALSE discarded. This is called after the
 fragmentation step has been called so all information about the event
 can be obtained from the LUND commons.
 The KSEC bank contains the cross section corresponding to the generated events and
 the cross section after AMCSEL and user cuts ( as defined by GSTD card)

2. write-up   :
   From the point of view of its physics content, this generator is very
similar to the MUSTAR generator (see MSTA01); it has however been desi-
gned to look for final states of the type e-gamma, where the unseen elec-
tron escapes along the beam pipe. Therefore, the electron mass terms have
to be kept.

1. code I.D.  : original version TIPTOP from S. Jadach and J. Kuhn;
                transmitted by E. Simopoulou in June 1988;
                interfaced in June 1988;
                contact people : E. Simopoulou and B. Bloch-Devaux.
 
2. write-up   :
   The TIPTOP Monte Carlo program simulates the following process :
                    e+ e- ----->  F Fbar  ( gamma ),
followed by the decays F    ----->  f1 + W    and W ---> f2 f3
and                    Fbar ------> f1bar+ W  and W ---> f4 f5.
 
   The final state fermion F ( Fbar ) may be choosen as :
- Heavy sequential lepton (Q = -1 , I3 = -0.5 , isopartner = Neutrino L),
- Top quark (Q =2/3 , I3 =  0.5 , isopartner = b quark),
- Fourth generation b quark (Q =-1/3, I3 = -0.5 , isopartner = c quark).
 
   The fermion f1 ( f1bar ) is the isopartner of the choosen F fermion,
and (f2,f3) and (f4,f5) are choosen among the possible lepton and quark
doublets in the (real/virtual) W decay.
   They may be choosen as : electron-neutrino e,
                            muon-neutrino mu,
                            tau-neutrino tau,
                            heavy lepton-neutrino L,
                            d quark-u quark,
                            s quark-c quark,
                            b quark-t quark,
                            l quark-h quark ( next flavor family...).
   The generator  produces the F-Fbar pair through the virtual photon and
Z exchange and includes initial state bremsstrahlung. The mass of the
fermion F and its isopartner f1 may be fixed by the user to arbitrary
values.
   Longitudinal beam polarization is handled, as well as the polarization
of F ( Fbar ) and its effect on decay distributions.
   The effect of the W propagator is taken into account for m(F) < m(W).
The decay into a real W of finite width, with subsequent W-decay inclu-
ding effects of the W-spin are handled when m(F) > m(W).
   Hadronization is taken care by using the Lund program, and so user can
modify the fragmentation scheme or other parameters using data cards as
described in the section referring to LUND02.

6. comments   :
 6.1 The program has the following limitations:
    .No transverse beam polarization is foreseen.
    .No final state radiation is considered.
    .No QCD corrections are taken into account in the case of heavy quark
production nor in the decay.
 6.2 In the case of Tau pair production ,the modified definition of decay
 modes and branching ratios ( as defined by the Tau group ) may be  used
 in Lund.
 6.3 If polarization is required ( PIM ,PIP not zero) , a bank KPOL is
 created for each event, giving polarisation information for the two beam
 electron/positron and for the two final fermions ( F / Fbar ).However,
 the structure is provided but not yet filled for the two last particles,
 as it has first to be understood properly.
 6.4  A bug has been found and corrected by E. Simopoulou in subroutine
 DETIPU, after agreement with the authors.
 6.5 MORE corrections by B. Bloch in the case of ttbar production(Feb89)
   -subroutine DECAY: in case of top production, the b and bbar coming
    from t and tbar decays are fragmented as independent jets.They were
    originally considered as a jet system and this gave rise sometimes
    to problems in the hadronisation strings.
   -in case of decay of the W+,W- in doublets of leptons (IDUB=1,2,3,4)
   the history of the final leptons is set as non decayed particles in
   the Lund convention (KS =0).They were originally set to 'unfragmented
   jets' (KS=1) which is a bit strange......

 1. code I.D.  : original version from G.Ganis
                 interfaced in July 1990;
                 contact people: G.Ganis ( LAL Orsay )
 
 2. Write-up
    The CHA001 MonteCarlo program simulates the following process:
 
       e+ e- ---> chi2+ chi2-
                    |     |
                    |     |--> chi0 f1 f2bar OR l- snu
                    |--> chi0 f3 f4bar OR l+ snu
 
  where chi2+ is the lightest chargino, chi0 the lightest neutralino, snu the
scalar neutrino and fx any fermion state.
 
  Production can occur through photon, z0 and scalar neutrino exchange;
interference terms are also taken into account.
  Decays into three-body final states can occur through exchange of W bosons and
scalar fermions:the intermediate scalar fermion state can be either real or
virtual.
  If the LSP (Lightest Susy Particle ) is neither 'chi0' nor 'snu' the program
stops.
  All possible decays patterns for 'chi2+' are indicated; when possible , the
corresponding decay width ( GeV ) is calculated.
  Chi2+ decays following branching ratios of implemented channels.
  It is also possible to ask for a particular channel, either topological
( hadronic, leptonic ) or exclusive.
 
  Masses and couplings for Susy particles can be either calculated from the
given set-up of parameters ( card GMSM ) or introduced by hand ( card GEN1 ).
 
  No polarization effect is handled.
 
  Hadronization of hadronic final states is done using the LUND   program.
  Lund parameters can be modified as usual by data cards ( see LUND02 doc)
 
  First order initial state radiation is taken into account.

 2. Write-up
    The CHI001 MonteCarlo program simulates the following process:
 
       e+ e- ---> Z0 ---> chi chip
                               |

                           |--> chi f2 f2bar
 
where chi is the lightest neutralino and chip the less to lightest neutralino.
 
  Production occurs through Z0 exchange and decays through virtual Z0 exchange.
Initial state radiation effect is included.
 
  Production process has to be chosen by user; chip decays following branching
ratios. It is also possible to ask for a particular channel, either topological
(  hadronic, leptonic, without neutrino ) or exclusive, for each chip decay.
 
  Hadronization of hadronic final states is done using the LUND JETSET 6.3
program.Lund parameters can be modified as usual by Dat cards ( see LUND02 doc)

2. write-up   :
   This code is based on a generator of the process
                e+e- --> (Z0)* H0 --> mu+mu- H0
(where H0 is the standard model Higgs boson (1 doublet)) that has been
written by Berends and Kleiss.
   The decay modes of the Higgs boson as well as the other decay modes
of the virtual Z0 (including the hadronic and neutrino modes) have been
modeled using the Lund JETSET 6.3 Monte Carlo. Optional initial state
radiation is available.
   As a simple by-product, the code offers the generation of the process
       ECM = Mass(t tbar)  --> gamma H0 (the Wilczek mechanism).
In this calculation, the H0 is also decayed with the help of LUND to a
final state that depends on its mass.

6. comments   :
 6.1 Since the kinematical cutoff in the photon spectrum of the initial
state radiation depends on the mass of the generated Z0-decay products,
one has to generate a photon spectrum for each of the 10 different
possible masses in the decay of the Z0 during the initialisation phase
(if one sets the parameter for the Z0 decay =0). This process takes
rather long (approx. 4sec of CPU time per mass value) and hence one has
to provide enough CPU time for the initialisation if one sets IRAD=1.

2. write-up   :
   This generator is a modified version of HIGG01 as described in this
library to include the option of using H0DECAY ( written by P.Janot)
to decay the generated Higgs.
   The user is thus asked to read first HIGG01 documentation , then
H0DECAY section of this paper if he wants to use this facility.
   The program is identical to HIGG01 if used with proper options.
   The following changes have been made by B.Bloch:
 2.1 Changes to the original code
    -remove RAN2 code (random number generator) and change all calls
     to RN by RNDM to avoid extraneous piling of calls if the user wants
     to use more popular random number generator (RANMAR for example).
 2.2 Changes to the interface code.
    -implement some FORTRAN77 statements to improve code readibility
    -update of history codes of particles created at the main vertex as
     defined by Lund convention: i.e. particles created at main vertex
     have mother # 0 rather than 1 as in HIGG01(where it looks as if they
     were coming from one of the beam electrons...)
    -new functionnality added to decay optionnally the Higgs through
     H0DECAY program
    -new possibility to initialise from Data Card the maximum value used
     for rejection when generating events.As this value depends strongly
     on Higgs mass value ,in particular at low mass,we give here some
     values obtained by running the program for few thousands of events

1. code I.D.  : original version (D0D0B) from E. Simopoulou  ;
                transmitted in February 1989;
                interfaced in February 1989 by B.Bloch
                contact people : E.Simopoulou/B.Bloch
 
2. write-up   :
 
   This generator produces the process :
     e+  e- -----> D0 D0bar  (gamma)
   where D0(D0bar) is  a lepto-quark particle which decays into a quark
   and a lepton.
    In some theoretical framework,this leptoquark particle may be as
 light as 20 Gev/c2.
    Production occurs through gauge boson exchange (gamma,Z,Z') in the
 s-channel and u-quark exchange in the t-channel.
    In general, there should be mixing between the two spin 0 particles
 D01 and D02.Here it is assumed that the mixing angle is 0 and that the
 paticles are mass-degenerated.
 Then the final states produced are :
     D0 D0bar,  D0cbar D0c,  D0 D0c,  D0cbar D0bar
    Under those conditions the cross-section varies from about 100 pbarn
 for a mass of 30 Gev/c2 , to about 3 pbarn for a mass of 45 Gev/c2.
    Concerning the decay of D0 and D0c , the following decay modes are
 considered :
       D0 ---> c-quark muon-      ( D0bar --> cbar-quark muon+)    100%
       ___
       D0c---> c-quark muon-      ( D0c   --> cbar-quark muon+)     50%
               s-quark neutrino mu( D0c   --> sbar-quark antineutrino mu)
                                                                    50%
 
     Giving an equal probability to each of the lepto quarks couples,
  this will result in the following final state probabilities:
                     mu- c cbar mu+     56.3 %
                     mu- c sbar numu    18.8 %
                    numu s cbar mu+     18.8 %
                    numu s sbar numu     6.1 %
 
   Initial state radiation to order o(alpha)  ( so called REMT package)
 is called under user's request.

    *************
 
1. code I.D.  : original versions HIGGZ0(from A.Schwarz-MPI)and H0SDECAY
                (from P.Janot-LAL)
                transmitted in December 1988;
                interfaced in October  1989;
                contact people : P.Janot/B.Bloch.
 
2. write-up   :
   This generator is a modified version of HIGG02 as described in this
library to include the option of using H0SDECAY ( written by P.Janot)
to decay the generated Higgs.
   The user is thus asked to read first HIGG01/02 documentation , then
H0SDECAY section of this paper if he wants to use this facility.
   The program is identical to HIGG01 if used with proper options.
   The following changes have been made by B.Bloch:
 2.1 Changes to the original code
    -remove RAN2 code (random number generator) and change all calls
     to RN by RNDM to avoid extraneous piling of calls if the user wants
     to use more popular random number generator (RANMAR for example).
 2.2 Changes to the interface code.
    -implement some FORTRAN77 statements to improve code readibility
    -update of history codes of particles created at the main vertex as
     defined by Lund convention: i.e. particles created at main vertex
     have mother # 0 rather than 1 as in HIGG01(where it looks as if they
     were coming from one of the beam electrons...)
    -new option to select only leptonic or hadronic decays for the Z (see
     data cards description)
    -new functionnality added to decay optionnally the Higgs through
     H0SDECAY program
    -new possibility to initialise from Data Card the maximum value used
     for rejection when generating events.As this value depends strongly
     on Higgs mass value ,in particular at low mass,we give here some
     values obtained by running the program for few thousands of events

2. write-up   :
 This generator works within the JETSET73 framework to simulate the
 production and decay of excited quarks.  Both pair- (q*q*)  and
 single- (qq*) production is available, being selected by the first
 parameter on the GENE card (1 = q*q*, with standard  coupling, 2 = qq*
 with Renards' coupling strength, lambda=1). Up- or down-type quarks
 are selected by the second parameter on the GENE card (7=down,8=up),
 but the actual flavour is selected through the quarks specified in
 the decay-channels.
 In case option 2 is selected, the decay of the q* is isotropic.
 A third option has been introduced in March 92 to allow generation of
 q q* with the angular distribution of q* as calculated by F.Boudjema
 in Hagiwara model.In this case a special routine is called to cope with
 hadronization of very low invariant mass jets created by the photonic
 decay of q* with high mass.

   No generator data cards is mandatory but ONE cards (GENE) may

In general the same cards as for JETSET73, but, as the 4th generation
quarks information is used for q*, cards must be used to set the 'low' and
'high' quarks masses within the observable range, and to create decay channels
for them; matrix elements set by code 32 on GRPL cards.

1. code I.D.  : original code SUSYGEN by S.Katsanevas, S.Melachroinos,
                Athens University, e-mail: katsanevas@vxcern.cern.ch,
                 melachroinos@grphla.cern.ch
 
                Interfaced by Y.Gao, P.Morawitz, February 96.
                contact people: Y.Gao, P.Morawitz and B. Bloch
 
2. write-up   :
  MSSM01 is an interfaced version (+ bug fixes) of the SUSYGEN generator,
a generator for SUSY pair production at LEP. All sizeable SUSY production
mechanisms are implemented - i.e. chargino, neutralino, slepton and
squark pair production. The generator works in either electroweak mode,
in which the user supplies the gaugino parameters and all scalar masses
at the electroweak scale, or alternatively in GUT mode, in which the
user supplies four SUSY parameters and the scalar mass parameter at the
GUT scale, and all other SUSY mass parameters are calculated by the
generator (assuming Grand Unification).
 
  The produced SUSY particles can cascade decay using a full calculation
of gaugino three-body decays and scalar decays to lower mass sparticles,
until eventually only LSPs (== the lightest neutralinos) remain, which
are stable.
Two-body gaugino decays, which are important in models in which one or
more of the scalars are lighter than one of the gauginos, are NOT
implemented!
  Further limitations of the generator: R-parity conservation is assumed.
Spin correlations are not implemented.

1. Code i.d.  : Original version HZHA01, from Patrick Janot (CERN)
                transmitted in september 1995

2. Write-up   :
   This generator is intended to contain the most recent knowledge of
   the production and decay of Higgs bosons (Standard Model h and
   Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model h,H,A) in e+e- colliders
   (LEPI, LEPII,NLC...)
 
   It allows eight different production processes to be simulated:
   (only 1, 5 and 7 are relevant for the Standard Model)
 
        1 :  e+e- --> h Z --> h f fbar
        2 :  e+e- --> H Z --> H f fbar
        3 :  e+e- --> h A
        4 :  e+e- --> H A
        5 :  e+e- --> nu nbar h, via W+W- fusion
        6 :  e+e- --> nu nbar H, via W+W- fusion
        7 :  e+e- --> e+  e-  h, via Z Z  fusion
        8 :  e+e- --> e+  e-  H, via Z Z  fusion
 
   together with 16 decay channels for each of the three Higgs bosons:
 
        1 :  gamma gamma    (with all charged particles in the loops)
        2 :  gluon gluon    (with all colored particles in the loops)
        3 :  tau+  tau-
        4 :  c     c~bar    (with running
        5 :  b     b~bar          quark masses
        6 :  t     t~bar               computed up to alpha_QCD**3)
        7 :  W+    W-       (with off-shell W's
        8 :  Z     Z                    and Z's)
        9 :  h,H --> AA, A --> Zh
       10 :  H,A --> hh
       11 :  gamma Z        (with all charged particles in the loops)
       12 :  e+    e-
       13 :  mu+   mu-
       14 :  s     s~bar
       15 :  chi   chi      (Also in the S.M. for invisible decays)
       16 :  chi+  chi-     (only in the MSSM)
 
    For this purpose, the squark, slepton, chargino, neutralino
    masses and mixings are computed in the MSSM framework. The
    squarks and sleptons are assumed to be too heavy and no
    Higgs bosons are allowed to decay to squarks/sleptons. However,
    decays to neutralino and charginos are enabled when kinemati-
    cally allowed. Therefore, the branching ratios of charginos
    and neutralinos are also computed and their decays simulated
    in the following channels :
 
        1 :  chi'' --> chi' Z*    --> chi' f fbar
        2 :  chi'' --> chi+ W-*   --> chi+ f f'bar
        3 :  chi'' --> chi' gamma
        4 :  chi+  --> chi' W*    --> chi' f f'bar
 
     where chi' and chi'' are two neutralinos and chi+ a chargino
     (m_chi'', m_chi+ > m_chi'). Cascade decays are also
     simulated. The lightest supersymmetric particle is
     assumed to be the lightest neutralino chi (if not so,
     a warning message appears and the program may stop)
     and R-parity is assumed to be conserved.
 
     In the Standard Model, the h --> chi chi decay is allowed to
     simulate invisible Higgs decays.
 
     In the MSSM, all the relevant massive particles (squarks
     sleptons, charginos, charged Higgses) are used to compute
     the gamma gamma, gluon gluon and Z gamma branching ratios.
 
     Finally, the MSSM Higgs boson pole masses are computed using
     the improved renormalization group equations at two loops
     (they may also be computed using the EPA [Effective Potential
     Approximation] for comparison purposes) from the work of
     M. Carena, M. Quiros, and C.E.M. Wagner (CERN-TH/95-157).
     A completely independent way of computing from H. Haber
     R. Hempfling and A. Hoang will be implemented soon.

    7020 - HZHA02
    *************
 
1. Code i.d.  : Original version HZHA01, from Patrick Janot (CERN)
                Modified as HZHA02 to include charged Higgs boson production
                by Gerardo Ganis (MPI)
                transmitted in July 1996
                contact people : Patrick Janot, Gerardo Ganis
 
2. Write-up   :
   This generator is intended to contain the most recent knowledge of
   the production and decay of Higgs bosons (Standard Model h and
   Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model h,H,A,H+-) in e+e- colliders
   (LEPI, LEPII,NLC...)
 
   It allows nine different production processes to be simulated:
   (only 1, 5 and 7 are relevant for the Standard Model)
 
        1 :  e+e- --> h Z --> h f fbar
        2 :  e+e- --> H Z --> H f fbar
        3 :  e+e- --> h A
        4 :  e+e- --> H A
        5 :  e+e- --> nu nbar h, via W+W- fusion
        6 :  e+e- --> nu nbar H, via W+W- fusion
        7 :  e+e- --> e+  e-  h, via Z Z  fusion
        8 :  e+e- --> e+  e-  H, via Z Z  fusion
        9 :  e+e- --> H+H-
 
   The three neutral Higgses are allowed to decay in 16 different ways:
 
        1 :  gamma gamma    (with all charged particles in the loops)
        2 :  gluon gluon    (with all colored particles in the loops)
        3 :  tau+  tau-
        4 :  c     c~bar    (with running
        5 :  b     b~bar          quark masses
        6 :  t     t~bar               computed up to alpha_QCD**3)
        7 :  W+    W-       (with off-shell W's
        8 :  Z     Z                    and Z's)
        9 :  h,H --> AA, A --> Zh
       10 :  H,A --> hh
       11 :  gamma Z        (with all charged particles in the loops)

       13 :  mu+   mu-
       14 :  s     s~bar
       15 :  chi   chi      (Also in the S.M. for invisible decays)
       16 :  chi+  chi-     (only in the MSSM)
 
    For this purpose, the squark, slepton, chargino, neutralino
    masses and mixings are computed in the MSSM framework. The
    squarks and sleptons are assumed to be too heavy and no
    Higgs bosons are allowed to decay to squarks/sleptons. However,
    decays to neutralino and charginos are enabled when kinemati-
    cally allowed. Therefore, the branching ratios of charginos
    and neutralinos are also computed and their decays simulated
    in the following channels :
 
        1 :  chi'' --> chi' Z*    --> chi' f fbar
        2 :  chi'' --> chi+ W-*   --> chi+ f f'bar
        3 :  chi'' --> chi' gamma
        4 :  chi+  --> chi' W*    --> chi' f f'bar
 
     where chi' and chi'' are two neutralinos and chi+ a chargino
     (m_chi'', m_chi+ > m_chi'). Cascade decays are also
     simulated. The lightest supersymmetric particle is
     assumed to be the lightest neutralino chi (if not so,
     a warning message appears and the program may stop)
     and R-parity is assumed to be conserved.
 
     In the Standard Model, the h --> chi chi decay is allowed to
     simulate invisible Higgs decays.
 
     In the MSSM, all the relevant massive particles (squarks
     sleptons, charginos, charged Higgses) are used to compute
     the gamma gamma, gluon gluon and Z gamma branching ratios.
 
     Finally, the MSSM Higgs boson pole masses are computed using
     the improved renormalization group equations at two loops
     (they may also be computed using the EPA [Effective Potential
     Approximation] for comparison purposes) from the work of
     M. Carena, M. Quiros, and C.E.M. Wagner (CERN-TH/95-157).
     A completely independent way of computing from H. Haber
     R. Hempfling and A. Hoang will be implemented soon.
 
     As far as the H+ boson is concerned the following 19 decay channels
     are defined:
 
        1 :  nu    e+
        2 :  nu    mu+
        3 :  nu    tau+
        4 :  u     d~bar
        5 :  u     s~bar
        6 :  u     b~bar
        7 :  c     d~bar
        8 :  c     s~bar
        9 :  c     b~bar
       10 :  W+    b d~bar           (not yet implemented)
       11 :  W+    b s~bar           (not yet implemented)
       12 :  W+    b b~bar           (not yet implemented)
       13 :  h     nu l+
       14 :  h     q q1~bar
       15 :  A     nu l+
       16 :  A     q q1~bar
       17 :  H     nu l+
       18 :  H     q q1~bar
       19 :  chi0  chi+              (not yet implemented)
 
     It is possible to work in a class of two-Higgs-doublet models
     where the relevant parameters (Higgs masses, vev's ratio and
     mixing angle among CP-even neutral states) are entered by
     data cards. If such is the case, decay 19 is automatically
     switched off. For channels 13-18, neutral Higgs are decayed
     as described above.

2. write-up   : see ALEPH-97-045, MCARLO 97-002 for more details.
             http://alephwww.cern.ch/ALPUB/note/note97/44/mssm02.ps
 MSSM02 is an interfaced version of the SUSYGEN generator, a generator
 for SUSY pair production at LEP. MSSM02 uses the April 96 version of
 SUSYGEN (V1.5), which at that time did not contain any implementation of
 R-parity violating decay processes. Therefore MSSM02 uses its own
 implementation of the R-parity violating decays.

 MSSM02 differs from MSSM01 in the following respects:
 a) MSSM02 now includes the radiative gaugino decays:
                      gaugino -> gamma gaugino'
                      gaugino -> Higgs (CP even/odd plus charged) gaugino'
 b) A number of serious bug-fixes.
 c) All R-parity violating decays are implemented.
 d) QED Final State Radiation from hard leptons.
 e) Improved hadronisation interface.
  All sizeable SUSY production mechanisms are implemented - i.e. chargino, 
 neutralino, slepton and squark pair production. The generator works in either
 electroweak mode, in which the user supplies the gaugino parameters and all 
 scalar masses at the electroweak scale, or alternatively in GUT mode, in 
 which the user supplies four SUSY parameters and the scalar mass parameter at
 the GUT scale, and all other SUSY mass parameters are calculated by the
 generator (assuming Grand Unification). All R-parity conserving and violating
 decays are simulated at some level, although the user interface for the 
 Rp-violating decays is not very elegant.

 Limitations of the generator: Spin correlations are not implemented. The
 generator does not implement two-body gaugino decays. No Gauge mediated
 SUSY breaking scenarios (i.e. no gravitinos). The generator does not take
 into account effects of lifetime.

    *************

1. code I.D.  : original code DFGT by C. Dionisi, S.Giagu, K.Fujii,
                T.Tsukamoto

                Interfaced by A.Colaleo, M.Maggi, March 97.
                contact people: A.Colaleo, M.Maggi and B. Bloch

2. write-up   :
    DFGT (ref. 3.1,3.2) is a chargino production and decay generator which 
 takes into account the amplitude due to the spin matching of the produced 
 and final state particles.
  The DFGT generator is developed in the minimal super-gravity scenario:
 the masses and the interaction of SUSY particles are described by m0, M2, 
 mu, tanb, A (ref.3.3).
  The user must supplies the SUSY parameters at the GUT scale, and all
 other SUSY mass parameters are calculated at the EW scale by the generator.
 By default the unification of gaugino masses term is assumed, which means
 Rscale=1 in the formula:

        M1=5/3 M2 tan^2(theta_W)*Rscale.
   In DFGT01 it is possible, changing the Rscale variable, to relax the GUT
 condition.
 In DFGT the LSP is always the lightest neutralino. Only the lightest chargino
 is produced and it decays only in neutralino fermions anti-fermions.
 The decay proceeds through a double two-body decay when kinematically allowed.

    The Monte Carlo integration and event generation is made by the 
 BASES/SPRING package v5.1, which is suited for the integration and generation
 of a very singular function.
 BASES/SPRING package (ref.3.4,3.5) performs stratified sampling of the 
 function in up 50 dimension.It works by dividing up the integration space 
 into a series of hypercubes. In each hypercube sample points of a definite 
 number are taken and the integral and variance are evaluated: summing up 
 results of all hypercubes gives the estimate of integral (this process is 
 called iteration).
  The execution of BASES consists of the grid optimization and the integration
 steps. After each iteration of the grid optimization step the grid is adjusted
 in order to make the dimension of hypercube narrower at the parts with larger 
 function value. In the integration step, the maximum value of the function in 
 each hypercube is calculated as well as the estimate of the integral.
   In the next program SPRING, the point in the hypercube with the maximum 
 value of the function is selected: at every iteration a point in the hypercube
 is  examined whether it is accepted or not. When this point is not accepted 
 another point is tested in the same hypercube. If the grid is not enough 
 optimized an event could be not generated (mis-generation) and a message is 
 printed. With an optimized grid, an high efficiency in generating a set of the
 independent variables is achieved (event generation). The behaviour of the 
 grid optimization and integration steps is controlled by the card.
   DFGT uses the BASES/SPRING package to sum over the helicity and phase space,
 to calculate the width and the cross section.

    The helicity amplitudes including decays into final state particles are 
 calculated at tree level by using the HELAS package (ref.3.4): a set of 
 subroutines to evaluate the Feynman diagrams allowing the calculation of the 
 matrix element.
    Initial state radiation,calculated at O(alpha**2), is included in the 
 structure function formalism (ref 3.6).
    The hadronization is then done via JETSET 7.4.

    The generator does not include R-parity violating chargino production or
R-parity violating decays. The final state radiation is not implemented.

                Modified as HZHA02 to include charged Higgs boson production by 
                Gerardo Ganis (MPI)
                Modified as HZHA03 by Patrick Janot with changesas described below. 
                Transmitted in November 1999

2. Write-up   :
    Latest updates available from the WEB :
       http://alephwww.cern.ch/~janot/Generators.html

   Current interfaced version is 105 as of June 5th, 2000.

   This generator is intended to contain the most recent knowledge of the production 
   and decay of Higgs bosons (Standard Model h and Minimal Supersymmetric Standard 
   Model h,H,A,H+-) in e+e- colliders (LEPI, LEPII, NLC..., although no beam polarization 
   is yet implemented for the latter.)

   It allows ten different production processes to be simulated:
   Only 1, 5 and 7 are relevant for the Standard Model. From the rest, the processes 2, 
   3, 4, 6, 8 and 9 are relevant in any two-Higgs-doublet model, of which the MSSM.
   The process 10 is enabled only in presence of anomalous triple boson couplings.
                             

        1 :  e+e- --> h Z --> h f fbar
        2 :  e+e- --> H Z --> H f fbar
        3 :  e+e- --> h A
        4 :  e+e- --> H A
        5 :  e+e- --> nu nbar h, via W+W- fusion or full calculation
        6 :  e+e- --> nu nbar H, via W+W- fusion or full calculation
        7 :  e+e- --> e+  e-  h, via Z Z  fusion or full calculation
        8 :  e+e- --> e+  e-  H, via Z Z  fusion or full calculation
        9 :  e+e- --> H+H-
       10 :  e+e- --> h gamma

   The three neutral Higgses are allowed to decay in 16 different ways:

        1 :  gamma gamma    (with all charged particles in the loops)
        2 :  gluon gluon    (with all colored particles in the loops)
        3 :  tau+  tau-
        4 :  c     c~bar    (with running
        5 :  b     b~bar          quark masses
        6 :  t     t~bar               computed up to alpha_QCD**3)
        7 :  W+    W-       (with off-shell W's
        8 :  Z     Z                    and Z's)
        9 :  h,H --> AA, A --> Zh
       10 :  H,A --> hh
       11 :  gamma Z        (with all charged particles in the loops)
       12 :  e+    e-
       13 :  mu+   mu-
       14 :  s     s~bar
       15 :  chi   chi      (Also in the S.M. for invisible decays)
       16 :  chi+  chi-     (only in the MSSM)
                                                    
    For this purpose, the squark, slepton, chargino, neutralino masses and mixings 
    are computed in the MSSM framework. The squarks and sleptons are assumed to be 
    too heavy and no Higgs bosons are allowed to decay to squarks/sleptons. However,
    decays to neutralino and charginos are enabled when kinematically allowed. Therefore,
    the branching ratios of charginos and neutralinos are also computed and their decays 
    simulated in the following channels :

        1 :  chi'' --> chi' Z*    --> chi' f fbar
        2 :  chi'' --> chi+ W-*   --> chi+ f f'bar
        3 :  chi'' --> chi' gamma
        4 :  chi+  --> chi' W*    --> chi' f f'bar

     where chi' and chi'' are two neutralinos and chi+ a chargino (m_chi'', m_chi+ > m_chi'). 
     Cascade decays are also simulated. The lightest supersymmetric particle is
     assumed to be the lightest neutralino chi (if not so, a warning message appears 
     and the program may stop) and R-parity is assumed to be conserved.

     In the Standard Model, the h --> chi chi decay is allowed to
     simulate invisible Higgs decays.
                                              
     In the MSSM, all the relevant massive particles (squarks, sleptons, charginos, 
     charged Higgses) are used to compute the gamma gamma, gluon gluon and Z gamma 
     branching ratios.

     The MSSM Higgs boson pole masses can be computed using the improved renormalization 
     group equations at one loop, with or without top threshold and gluino genuine two loop
     corrections (they may also be computed using the EPA [Effective Potential Approximation] 
     for comparison purposes) from the work of M. Carena, M. Quiros, and C.E.M. Wagner 
     (CERN-TH/95-157). A completely independent way of computing from H. Haber, R. Hempfling 
     and A. Hoang has also been implemented.

     As they are coded, the anomlaous couplings may affect only h, but neither H nor A. 
     These couplings are treated as a modification to the standard model couplings, and 
     the MSSM is left out for the time being. As a consequence, they require ISM to be set 
     to 1 to be effective.
                                  
     As far as the H+ boson is concerned the following 19 decay channels are defined:

        1 :  nu    e+
        2 :  nu    mu+
        3 :  nu    tau+
        4 :  u     d~bar
        5 :  u     s~bar
        6 :  u     b~bar
        7 :  c     d~bar
        8 :  c     s~bar
        9 :  c     b~bar
       10 :  W+    b d~bar           (not yet implemented)
       11 :  W+    b s~bar           (not yet implemented)
       12 :  W+    b b~bar           (not yet implemented)
       13 :  h     nu l+
       14 :  h     q q1~bar
       15 :  A     nu l+
       16 :  A     q q1~bar
       17 :  H     nu l+
       18 :  H     q q1~bar
       19 :  chi0  chi+              (not yet implemented)

     It is possible to work in a class of two-Higgs-doublet models where the relevant 
     parameters (Higgs masses, vev's ratio and mixing angle among CP-even neutral states) 
     are entered by data cards. If such is the case, decay 19 is automatically
     switched off. For channels 13-18, neutral Higgses are decayed as described above.

     Compared to previous versions the following changes/upgrades have been implemented :

2.1.- Precision
      All routines have been rewritten in double precision (REAL*8, COMPLEX*16).
      Many protections against negative squared masses, and the like, were implemented.
2.2.- Bug in hZ production
      The axial and vector couplings were always those of the muon in SUBROUTINE DSIGKLEI, 
      leading to wrong angular distributions for neutrinos (who cares?) and for quarks in 
      the Higgs-strahlung process (this change might affect slightly the selections effi-
      ciencies, but I haven't checked it.)
2.3.- Numerical singularity (0/0) in h -> Z gamma decay
      There was a non-regularized singularity for this branching fraction when mh -> mZ. 
      Was 99.99% solved with the double precision rewriting. The 0/0 singularity has been 
      protected away for the remaining 0.01%.
2.4.- Interference between HZ and boson fusion
      Concerns h e+e-, h nu_e nu_e(bar), H e+e- and H nu_e nu)e(bar) final states.
      Upon request, i.e., with 2 in the card PRYN for the processes 5, 6, 7, or 8 (WW->h, 
      WW->H, ZZ->h and ZZ->H):

           * 0 = not requested
           * 1 = only boson fusion - as before
           * 2 = complete matrix element squared including the
                 interference with hZ -> h nu_e nu_e(bar), h e+e-
                 and/or HZ -> H nu_e nu_e(bar), H e+e-.

      the complete calculation of the h/Hee and h/Hnn final states is performed, including 
      the interference with h/HZ and the normal h/HZ contribution. Requesting hZ and HZ 
      simultaneously does not cause double counting in the latter case, because the corresponding 
      branching fractions of the Z (Z -> nu_e nu_e(bar) or Z -> e+e-), are then switched off in 
      the Higgs-strahlung process.

      The total cross section calculation is a bit longer than before (three contributions 
      instead of one). The slowing down of the event generation due to the additional variations 
      of the interference term is not noticeable.
2.5.- Implement radiative corrections to Higgs boson masses in the MSSM from Haber et al.
      Philosopically similar to Carena et al, but technically different. May give an estimate 
      for systematic uncertainties.
2.6.- Implement top threshold two loop corrections (Carena et al)
      Makes the predictions of Carena et al. perfectly agree with the predictions from the fully 
      diagrammatic two-loop calculations for the Higgs boson mass radiative corrections (once 
      the scheme dependence of the latter result is removed by a proper redifinition of the
      input quantities.)
      In addition, and for free, Marcela, Carlos and Mariano kindly provided me with other genuine 
      two loop corrections, while waiting for the full two loop effective potential results which
      they will be developing soon.
      The gluino corrections can be expected to modify the hbb and the Hbb couplings, and lead 
      to suppressed b bbar decays with respect to tau+tau- decays. Marcela and Carlos will provide
      us with a "benchmark" set of parameters.
      Note that gaugino mass unification is assumed in the program for neutralinos, charginos and 
      gluinos. Only one gaugino mass term is therefore neede
2.7.- SUSY spectrum in the SUGRA framework
      It is now possible to compute the SUSY spectrum (and therefore, the radiative corrections to 
      the Higgs boson masses and couplings) in the framework of the grand-unified SUGRA mass relations 
      involving m0, m1/2, mu, A, and tan(beta).
2.8.- Popular request
      On popular request, the gaugino mass term M (a linear combination of M1 and M2) was replaced by M2.
        *****  Change your MSSM scan codes accordingly ! *****
2.9.- Anomalous Higgs couplings
      These anomalous couplings concern the triple boson interaction (h gamma gamma, h Z gamma, h Z Z, 
      and h W+W-) and therefore affect the following production processes and decay channels:

        o e+e- -> h gamma;
        o e+e- -> h Z;
        o h -> gamma gamma;
        o h -> gamma Z;
        o h -> Z Z;
        o h -> W+W-.

      The boson fusion into Higgs boson is in principle also modified but I have not computed/incorporated 
      the corresponding cross section, neither did I modify the interference term.

      See Reference: M.C. Gonzalez-Garcia, "Anomalous Higgs Couplings", hep-ph/9902321, for the Feynman 
      rules. All matrix elements squared, cross sections and branching fractions were computed by
      hand and compared to the curves presented in the aforementioned reference.

      All couplings not already significantly constrained by usual TGC measurements at LEP1 and LEP2 
      are allowed to be non zero, namely fB, fW, fBB and fWW.

2. write-up   :
   This generator generates the flux of cosmics muons at the sea level
and computes the energy loss of each muon in the rock above the ALEPH
cavern (top of cavern is assumed to be 88 meters underground; the rock
traversed has a density of 30000 g/m2).
   The initial spectrum is generated in the range [Emin,Emax]. The event
is accepted if the current energy at the top of the cavern is larger than
Ecut.
   The surface element, origine of the muon, is computed and the track
is propagated down to the Aleph detector surface. The detector is
considered as a cylinder characterized by its radius R ( 650 cm) and its half
length in z ( 600 cm).
   The user has a possibility to define a cylinder ( with smaller dimensions
than the full Aleph detector ) which should be intercepted by the cosmic track.
The magnetic field inside the Aleph detector is neglected when checking if a
given track would cross the restricted cylinder.This can lead to small effects
on efficiency at cylinder boundary.It is thus recommended to define slightly
larger cylinder than needed.

                contact people : E. Lange and B. Bloch-Devaux.
 
2. write-up   :
   BEAMGA is an event generator for beam gas events in the LEP collider.
It may handle the interaction from beam particles with gaz in one out of
five differents ways, as selected by the user:
               - deep inelastic lepton nucleon scattering,
               - moeller scattering,
               - bhabha scattering,
               - mott scattering,
               - rosenbluth scattering.
 
   The deep inelastic lepton scattering calculation uses the LEPTO code.
The main modifications to LEPTO which is part of the program are:
   -  New set of structure functions as in LEPTO version 5,
   -  No QCD Processes,
   -  No weakcharged processes,
   -  LST(2) Disabled,
   -  LST(24) disabled,
   -  Warning message in LEPTOX if WMIN to small.
   The recoil of the target is neglected in the Mott scattering calcula-
tion.

    ZBAT01   Stand alone program not to be interfaced.
    ******
 
1. code I.D.  : original version (ZBATCH,ZHADRO,ZAPPQ,ZAPPH)
                from L. Garrido - Cern;
                transmitted in August 1989;
                not to be interfaced
                last updated :    September 1989
                contact people : L. Garrido and G. Bonneaud.
 
2. write-up   :
  The author is Gerrit Burgers (version of February 1989).
  2.1 ZBATCH
     The program ZBATCH calculates a table of the total cross section for
     initial state radiation for the reaction
                      e+e- --> mu+mu-(gam(gam))
     including weak corrections except for box diagrams (see ref.3.1).
   No final state effects are taken into account. The electron mass has
been neglected where possible. The resummation of soft photons to all
orders is included. Also the fermion loop contribution to the vertex
correction is not incorporated (numerically small).
   For the calculation of the hard part of dsig/ds', DSIGH, which is the
sum of the order-alfa part, DSIGH1, and the order-alfa**2 part, DSIGH2
2nd order calculation, see ref. 3.2.
   For the calculation of Li2(x), Li3(x) and S12(x), see ref. 3.3.
   2.2 ZHADRO
      Gives the cross section for the reaction:
                 e+e- --> q+qbar(gam(gam))
      (it uses the same aproximations that ZBATCH)
   2.3 ZAPPQ
   The improved Born cross section (integrated cross section) calculation
expressed in nbarn for the reaction
                      e+ e-  --->  mu+ mu-
includes: one loop Z Self-energy + corrected Z width, photon vacuum pola-
risation, photon-Z mixing, non-photonic vertex corrections,
but does not include: photonic corrections, box diagrams.
The exponentiation is done as in ref 3.4. The differences between
the various Born approximations are explained in ref 3.5.
   2.4 ZAPPH
      Gives the cross section for the reaction:
                 e+e- --> q+qbar(gam(gam))
      (it uses the same aproximations that ZAPPQ)

    EXPO02   Stand alone program not to be interfaced.
    ******
 
1. code I.D.  : original version EXPOSTAR from D. Kennedy (Dec.88);
                transmitted in December 1988;
                not to be interfaced
                last updated : 28 February 1989
                contact people : H. Burkhardt and A. Blondel.
 
2. write-up   :
   The expostar program allows the calculation of electroweak quantities
at LEP/SLC energies, including radiative effects.
 The weak loops are calculated in the effective lagrangian approach,the
'starred-scheme'. Weak vertices are calculated in the massless quark
approximation, thus the top-mass effect for the b-quark vertex is absent;
this is a 7 Mev effect on the width for mt = 200 Gev, and is unimportant
for the b-bbar asymmetry.
   Initial state radiation includes multiple photon emission,by the
structure function approach (Nicrosini & Trentadue).
   The QED boxes and final state radiation are not included; they are
negligible for the line shape and polarized asymmetries;they should be
understood for the forward-backward asymmetry in a different way , using
BREM03 for instance.
 EXPOSTAR generates only two four vectors for each event,the two outgoing
fermions. The missing momentum represents the photons.
   The soft and virtual part of expostar is in part identical to the
BREM5/6 programs.
   Expostar was not designed to provide a full simulation of the final
state on an event-by-event basis (in some sense it is not really an event
generator). Only simple experimental cuts can be simulated.
   For detailed simulations of detector resolution and cuts, BREM5/6
should be used.
   Expostar is very useful in providing precise values of quantities like
Z cross sections, line shape and width, forward-backward and polarization
asymmetries and their parameter dependence: top and higgs mass, number
of light neutrinos, tree level rho-parameter, Lambda-QCD.
   See the header of the programm for updates since EXPO01.

.f  LUTAUD_6.3
    ***********
 
1. code I.D.  : To be used in the framework of LUND (JETSET 6.3)
                transmitted in June 1988 by D.Lloyd-Owen /LAL-Orsay
                implemented in June 1988;
                contact people : D.Lloyd-Owen and B. Bloch-Devaux
   NOW OBSOLETE ..... JETSET 6.3 is no longer used 

2. write-up  and usage :
  Many generators , able to create tau final states, use the LUND scheme
to decay them subsequently.The available decay modes and branching ratios
do not reflect the present experimental situation.
  In order to implement the most up-to-date values, some LUND routines
have to be modified so they can handle more decay modes and higher
multiplicity final states than foreseen primarily.
 2.1- INITIALISATION (mandatory):The user must have the sequence
      CALL  LUTAUD (IFL)
    Inputs    : None except LUND COMMON
    Outputs   : modify some LUND COMMON
                IFL   = error flag (0 is ok)
 
    LUND normally has space for up to 4 decay products only for a given
    decay mode.  In order to accomodate the multi-pion final states of
    the tau, we will do the following:
    If  CBR(IDC+1) < 0 , then the 8 locations  KDP(4*IDC-3)  to
    KDP(4*IDC+4)  will be scanned for decay-product particle codes.
    A special version of the LUND routine  LUDECY  must be used in
    conjunction with this routine.It is also necessary to load a special
    version of the LUND routine  LULIST if this routine is called by the
    user.
 
    The branching modes and branching frations incorporated are:
        1. nu rho-                    .2562
        2. nu e- nu                   .1897
        3. nu mu- nu                  .1817
        4. nu A1-                     .1392
        5. nu pi-                     .0993
        6. nu pi- pi+ pi- pi0         .0634
        7. nu pi- pi0 pi0 pi0         .0496
        8. nu K*-                     .0129
        9. nu K-                      .0070
       10. nu pi- pi+ pi- pi+ pi-     .0005
       11. nu pi- pi+ pi- pi+ pi- pi0 .0005
 
2.2- EVENT PROCESSING:to decay the  Taus  ,use the sequence:
     CALL LUEXEC   as provided by LUND generator
 
    It will internally call the subroutine LUDECY(IP) to perform
 the tau decay, which has been modified accordingly to permit decays
 into > 4 particles.
    For debugging purposes the user may also invoke the LUND printing
 routine :
           CALL  LULIST (MLIST)
    which has been modified also to print decays into > 4 particles.
2.3- TERMINATION :Nothing special must be done
 
3. references :
    The values are based on an analysis performed by Mark II:
        P.R. Burchat et al., Phys. Rev. D35 (1987) 27
    but have been rescaled to reflect the topological branching
    fractions quoted in:
        B.C. Barish & R. Stroynowski, Phys. Rep. 157 (1988) 1.
 
4. data cards :
  No special Data card is needed
 
5. header informations : no change is foreseen to run header or event
 header  informations
 
6. comments   :
 
7. files :
    The source code of the modified LUND  routines (and only those)
    is maintained as a Historian library, and may be linked to any

2. write-up  and usage :
  Many generators , able to create tau final states, use the JETSET scheme
to decay them subsequently.The available decay modes and branching ratios
do not reflect the present experimental situation.
  In order to implement the most up-to-date values, one can link to an external library
better suited for Tau decays. In particular the Tauola library is able to deal with tau 
polarization effects  which JETSET does not handle.

1. code I.D.  : original version (H0DECAY) from P. Janot - CERN/EP - LAL
                transmitted in December 1988;
                interfaced in December 1988;
                contact people : P. Janot and B. Bloch-Devaux
 
2. write-up  and usage :
  The program consists of a set of subroutines acting on the LUND data
structure.It generates four-momenta of particles coming from the decay
of a neutral standard Higgs with a given mass and momentum.
 
From the user point of view, this program may be called at three levels :
 2.1- INITIALISATION (mandatory):The user must have the sequence
     CALL H0INIT(XMH,TAU0)          ( XMH and TAU0 in REAL*4  )
in his program during the initialisation phase, where XMH is the Higgs
mass as defined in his generator(input, in GeV) and TAU0 is the Higgs
lifetime in its rest frame returned to the user  (in seconds ) for
subsequent use when updating the Particle bank PART.
 What H0INIT does is mainly to compute analytically the branching ratios
 of all the possible channels ,in order to optimize the simulation.
  The following channels are considered:
          Number               Channel
            1             H0 --> Gamma Gamma
            2             H0 --> Gluon Gluon
            3             H0 --> e+   e-   (Gamma)
            4             H0 --> mu+  mu-  (Gamma)
            5             H0 --> tau+ tau- (Gamma)
            6             H0 --> L+   L-   (Gamma)
            7             H0 --> u    ubar (Gamma or Gluon)
            8             H0 --> d    dbar (Gamma or Gluon)
            9             H0 --> s    sbar (Gamma or Gluon)
           10             H0 --> c    cbar (Gamma or Gluon)
           11             H0 --> b    bbar (Gamma or Gluon)
           12             H0 --> t    tbar (Gamma or Gluon)
           13             H0 --> Q    Qbar (Gamma or Gluon) (4th
           14             H0 --> R    Rbar (Gamma or Gluon) gen.)
           15             H0 --> Z0   Z0
           16             H0 --> W+   W-
and in the non perturbative QCD range  :
           17             H0 --> Pi0  Pi0
           18             H0 --> Pi+  Pi-
           19             H0 --> K0   K0bar
           20             H0 --> K+   K-
           21             H0 --> Eta  Eta
           22             H0 --> rho0 rho0
           23             H0 --> rho+ rho-
           24             H0 --> omega0 omega0
 
  In H0INIT,the user may give his own run conditions through one or two
data cards (see below).
2.2- EVENT PROCESSING:to decay the  Higgs ,use the sequence:
      CALL H0DECAY(PH,KCHAN,KFSTAT)
                           (PH(4) is REAL*4, KCHAN and KFSTAT INTEGER)
  where
PH is the four-momentum of the Higgs(input, PH(4) = energy, in GeV)
KCHAN the decay channel identifier(output,as defined above)
KFSTAT the final state identifier (1=2 body final state
                                   2=2 fermions+1 photon
                                   3=2 quarks+1 gluon)
Output particles are stored in LUJETS common block in standard format
2.3- TERMINATION (optional):At the end of job, the user can add
       CALL H0FINI(FACTOR)                    (FACTOR in REAL*4)
where FACTOR is the ratio of partial width corresponding to requested
channels to total Higgs decay width (output,unitless).
 The total cross section should be multiplied by this factor.
H0FINI gives also statistical information depending on the debug level.

5. header informations :
 5.1 run header
   Parameter bank KHIG contains 28 integer and 6 real*4 values
corresponding to :
         ICHAN(1:24),IFRG,IDCY,ILOR,IFTH,CUTPH,CUTGL,CUQQG,QKU,QKD,QKS
 
 5.2 event header
   Process identifier may be modified by combining the extra information
   from H0DECAY call:
                      KCHAN :Decay channel identifier
                      KFSTAT:Final state topology identifier
 
   Weight = the events are generated without weight, so no modification
 
6. comments   :
 6.1 All physical constants are taken from LUND block data's.Therefore,if
the user wants to change them, it is enough to modify the block data's
before calling H0INIT.As an example,to get rid of the fourth generation
particles L,Q and R, the corresponding lines should be reset in the
/LUDATn/ commons.
 
 6.2 CUTPH and CUTGL are changed internally if they are too small in
 order to preserve the program reliability.A warning message is issued.
 
 6.3 CUQQG doesn't account for quark mass effect.In other words,the quark
 -gluon "invariant mass" is 0 if the quark momentum is 0. CUQQG can be 0
 but it is better to choose a realistic value, since a 3-jet event with 2
 degenerated jets has a 2-jet topology.The default value is set to .1 in
 XMH units.
 
 6.4 In the range 2M(q) < XMH < 2M(q)+ PAR(22),where M(q)is the q quark
mass and PAR(22)is the minimum energy for a color singlet jet system to
be fragmented(see Lund documentation),the qqbar pair is treated exactly
as a q-onium,although the q-onium is a spin 1 particle.This treatment is
done using a slightly modified version of the subroutine LUONIA from the
LUND library (JETSET).

2. write-up  and usage :
  The program consists of a set of subroutines acting on the LUND data
structure.It generates four-momenta of particles coming from the decay
of a neutral (standard or SUSY) Higgs with a given mass and momentum.
The Standard Higgs is number 1 (H0); The lightest SUSY scalar is 2 (H02);
the SUSY pseudoscalar is 3 (H03). From the user point of view, this
program may be called at three levels :
In addition to the introduction of SUSY Higgs's, there is an improved
version of the decay of Higgs for masses below 2 Gev.
 2.1- INITIALISATION (mandatory):The user must have the sequence
     CALL H0INIT(XMH,TAU0,V2V1)     ( XMH(3),TAU0(3),V2V1 in REAL*4  )
in his program during the initialisation phase, where XMH are the higgs
masses as defined in his generator(in GeV), TAU0 the Higgs lifetimes
(in seconds ) and V2V1 is the vaccuum expectation value ratio (H02/H01).
XMH(1), XMH(2) and V2V1 are inputs. XMH3(3) is then computed and the
TAU0 are returned to the main program for subsequent use when updating
the Particle bank PART.
 What H0INIT does is mainly to compute analytically the branching ratios
 of all the possible channels ,in order to optimize the simulation.
  The following channels are considered:
          Number               Channel
            1             H0 --> Gamma Gamma

            6             H0 --> L+   L-   (Gamma)
            7             H0 --> u    ubar (Gamma or Gluon)
            8             H0 --> d    dbar (Gamma or Gluon)
            9             H0 --> s    sbar (Gamma or Gluon)
           10             H0 --> c    cbar (Gamma or Gluon)
           11             H0 --> b    bbar (Gamma or Gluon)
           12             H0 --> t    tbar (Gamma or Gluon)

  In H0INIT,the user may give his own run conditions through a few data
cards (see below).
2.2- EVENT PROCESSING:to decay the  Higgs ,use the sequence:

                           (PH(4) is REAL*4, KCHAN,KFSTAT,KHIG INTEGER)
  where
PH is the four-momentum of the Higgs(input, PH(4) = energy, in GeV)
KCHAN the decay channel identifier(output,as defined above)
KFSTAT the final state identifier (output,
                                   1=2 body final state

                                   3=2 quarks+1 gluon)
KHIG is the Higgs identifier (input, see above)
Output particles are stored in LUJETS common block in standard format
SUSY Higgses are called HG02 and HG03 in this area and their LUND
numbers are determined internally.
2.3- TERMINATION (optional):At the end of job, the user can add
       CALL H0FINI(FACTOR)                (FACTOR(3) in REAL*4)
where FACTOR(i) is the ratio of the partial width corresponding to
requested channels to the total decay width for the Higgs number i
(output,unitless).  The total cross section should be multiplied by
these factors.
H0FINI gives also statistical information depending on the debug level.

LUND library (JETSET).
 
 6.5 New possibility to hadronise quarks form Higg's decay by a call to
LUSHOW ( Parton shower evolution) rather than by a correction o(alpha_s).
This is valid for high Higg's masses.
 
  To trigger this option, user must set CUTLG value to 1. in GHGG card.
CUTLG is the cutoff value ( in mH/2 units ) on gluon energy in the decay:
                   H0 --> q qbar gluon
If CUTLG=1., only H0 --> q qbar is allowed and LUSHOW will take care of gluon(s)
generation.

1. code I.D.  : To be used with any code which needs random numbers
                transmitted in December 88 by WISCONSIN group.
                implemented in January 1989;
                contact people :Jim Wear & John Hilgart,B.Bloch
 
2. write-up  and usage :
    Several considerations have triggered the implementation of a "good
random number generator":
  -RNDM is known to be a rather 'poor quality' generator.
  -Insure that each institute has independent random number sequences
 when starting a common event production.
 To achieve this, a new random number generator (RANMAR) advocated by
 Fred James may be used together with any code .
    John Hilgart and Jim Wear  have written a small interface between
 RANMAR and RNDM which should be transparent to all users.
 
 2.1- INITIALISATION : RDMIN(ISEED)
 RNDM may be initialised by providing one seed but RMARIN needs two.
 The calling sequence have been conserved but ISEED is not used.
 The two seeds needed are taken from a Data Card RMAR as explained below.
 If RANMAR is not initialised, it will do so with recommended values.
 
 2.2- CALLING SEQUENCE:RNDM(DUM)
  RNDM function call returns one value at a time.RANMAR subroutine is
 known to be more efficient if working in an array mode, that is called
 once to return a (large) array of numbers.
  The present implementation builds RNDM as a server of random numbers
 from an array of 100 values delivered by RANMAR.
 
2.3- TERMINATION :RDMOUT(ISEED)
 RDMOUT returns the last number used which may be subsequently given as
 a seed for RDMIN and then allows to continue with the random numbers
 sequence.
 There is a facility to restart the sequence of random numbers where it
 was left , provided by Fred James.This requires 3 integer numbers (they
 are not the initial seeds!),then it will reproduce the whole sequence
 from the beginning and bring you up to where you were.
 The present implementation of RDMOUT returns the 3 necessary numbers .

4. data cards :
    A data card, RMAR,may be used to initialise the two integer seeds
 
*  use RANMAR generator for random numbers
*  INSEED : first seed (range assigned per institute)
*  LOSEED : second seed (incremented locally for new runs)
*      INSEED          LOSEED (1-30000)
RMAR     100               1
 
    A data card, RINI,may be used to restart the generator where it was
 
*  restart  RANMAR generator for random numbers
*  INITIJ : first number for reinitialisation
*  NTOTIN : second number           "
*  NTOTON : third  number           "
*      INITIJ          NTOTIN        NTONON
RINI      I              J             K
* where I,J,K come from calling RMARUT
 
5. header informations : no change is foreseen to run header or event
 header  informations for now.If we adopt RANMAR as the ALEPH official
 random number generator, we can envisage to store the 3 restarting
 numbers at the end of each event in the event header, as a standard.
 
6. comments   :
 6.1 Two seeds are required to initialize a sequence of random numbers
which is 10**30 long(as compared ,RNDM has a period of 10**9 and other
problems as well).More attractive is that,since each seed may have a
value between 0 and 30000, we have some 30000*30000 independent random
numbers sequences available to us.
The following scheme could be used(see Table below)
    The first seed is an "institution-specific" seed which is any integer
within an institution's assigned range of 100 values.
    The second seed can take any value between 0 and 30000 inclusive.
This system insures that each institution has 3*10**6 independant
sequences available for its generation needs.

        -----------------------------------------------------
 
6.2 one should be aware that the facility given to restart the random
number sequence will practically rebuild  the whole chain from the
beginning...thus it may not be well suited for programs like GALEPH
which make a very large number of calls per event.
 
7. files :
    The source code of the modified RNDM routines (and only those) is
    maintained as Fortran and binary files, and may be linked to any
    job which needs it .

5. DATA CARDS FOR KINGAL

.f TRIG  : number of generated / accepted events

     A facility to generate a given number of accepted events
  in KINGAL is available on a standard basis. This is useful for
  users who reject part of the events by setting up a non zero status flag 
  in the interface routine ASKUSE. This way users do not have to guess the 
  total number of triggers to be tried before getting a given number of 
  accepted events within their selection.

1. Format
    The Accepted events facility is triggered by a third number on
    the TRIG card :      
                    TRIG   n1   n2   n3

      n1 is the first trigger number to be generated ( which may be
         different from 1 )
      n2 is the last  trigger number to be generated
      n3 is the number of accepted triggers to be generated (optional)
    The program determines automatically if n3 is present.
    If absent,no check is made on accepted events and NGEN = n2-n1+1 events
    are generated. Only events with status code 0 from ASKUSE are written
    out to file.
    If n3 is present , n2 is then ignored , but trigger numbers start 
    at number n1. Events are generated untill n3 accepted events are obtained.

2. Action

       After the general KINGAL initialization and the standard call to the
    interface routine ASKUSI(IGCOD) , the program starts generating events .
       Before generating a new event and depending on the chosen option ,it 
    checks if the requested number of accepted or generated events is reached.
       If so , it jumps to the end of Run procedure.
       If not, it goes on, calling ASKUSE and counting the accepted events 
    ( status code equal to 0 ) and generated events ( any status code).
       No particular version of ALEPHLIB is necessary , all modifications 
    beeing handled by the main steering program KINGAL on the KIN disk or 
    directory.
       At the end of job , timing statistics are given for generated events 
    as well as for accepted events.

.f KTMX : to force particle decay at KINGAL level

       During analysis , users are often facing the problem of getting large
     statistics samples at KINGAL level only.
      In that case , they need to decay not only short life-time particles
     ( like Pi0's ,eta's , B and D's ...) but also long-life time particles
     like K0_short and Lambda's which are usually decayed only by GALEPH
     during tracking through the detector.
       The facility is generator independent, user friendly and flexible.

1. Format

          KTMX   Tmax

    forces the decay of particles having a proper life-time smaller than Tmax
    ( to be given in seconds)

2. Action
    If no card KTMX is present , the default 10E-15 seconds is used.
    A message is printed out by KINGAL giving the value used in the job.
    As an example a card KTMX with Tmax = 1.E-10 would force the decay
    of K0_s ( Tau0 = 0.89E-10) but would leave Lambda0 stable
    ( Tau0 = 0.26E-09) while Tmax = 1.E-09 would force both decays.
    The facility was introduced in Alephlib version 13.8 in 1992 .

.f SVRT/XVRT  Vertex smearing definition

      When generating the primary vertex position (interaction vertex), one can
      add a gaussian smearing along the 3 axis (x,y,z) to the nominal position
      through the SVRT card. An offset can be added using the XVRT card and 
      optionnaly a spread of the offset can be introduced.

1. Format

      SVRT sx   sy   sz

      XVRT  dx  dy  dz  ( sdx  sdy   sdz )

     All values are to be given in cm.

2. Action
     If no SVRT card is given, some typical value will bw used.
     If no XVRT card is given, zero values will bw used.

     Measured smearing values have been used for each year of Data taking :
     last update of input values ( M.Maggi) on July 30,1999 for LEP I 91 to 95

.f GSCL/GSCE  Energy scan facility
     
      It is sometimes interesting to generate in one go a set of runs where
    the only difference is the center of mass energy.
      This is possible within KINGAL using the Energy scan facility. It can 
    be done on the basis of the Luminosity (GSCL card) or the number of 
    events (GSCE card) to be generated (or accepted) at each energy.
    The TRIG card with a third parameter can be used in conjunction with one
    of the mentionned card.
      Only one of the mentionned cards can be activated at a time , of course.
      The facility is available if the generator provides two service routines 
    XKSECT(ECM) and USKRIN(ECM) and the Librarian is made aware of their
    availability ......
      At execution time , Kingal checks that the generator is properly
    interfaced to the requested  Energy scan facility .If not, a warning
    message is printed out and the program is stopped.
      Three histograms ( ID = 9000,9001,9002 9003) are automatically
    filled with respectively cross section,Luminosity ,generated number
    of events and accepted number of events as a function of CM Energy.
      No particular version of ALEPHLIB or GALEPH is necessary .
      In case the resulting production has to be entered in the MC
    production book-keeping , SCANBOOK will be able to handle it,
    thanks to Jacques Boucrot.
    As of today,the following generators are supporting the Energy scan option:
                                        code
          LUND03       JETSET  7.3      5011
          ARIA01       ARIADNE 3.3      5014
          CHA001       CHARGINO         7006
          NUSG01       NUSGAMMA         7015

          
1. Format
             GSCL  Energy scan on a Luminosity basis
             GSCE  Energy scan on a fraction of events basis

          GSCL   E1 L1 E2 L2 .........   En Ln
 
    GSCL contains as many couples ( Energy-Luminosity ) as needed,where
    Ei is the Energy given in Gev
    Li is the Luminosity given in inverse nb

          GSCE   E1 x1 E2 x2 .........   En xn

    GSCE contains as many couples ( Energy-fraction of events) as needed,where
    Ei is the Energy given in Gev
    xi is the corresponding Fraction of events ( in the range [0.,1.] )

2. Action
      For each energy it will
    o determine how many events should be generated :
      GSCL card : by calling the function XKSECT(ECM) which returns the 
      Cross-section value in nb at Energy ECM.
      The product ( Cross-section * Luminosity ) determines the number of 
      events to be generated (or accepted if TRIG card used with 3 inputs) 
      in the Energy run .
      GSCE card : by computing the product (Fraction*NGEN or NACC) to determine
      the number of events to begenerated or accepted.       
    o reset Histograms if needed ( see HNOC card )
    o set up the run number,starting from the number given in the RUN card
    ( or 1 if no such card is available ) and incrementing it by 10 units for
    each of the following Energy runs.A check is performed so that the Run 
    number stays within the MC Run numbers range [1,1999].
    o Call the subroutine USKRIN(ECM) which  should  reinitialize  the
    relevant quantities in the generator ( derived quantities  depending
    upon energy , header bank KPAR..) , reset event counters, etc....
    o Reissue the Run header banks RUNH , RUNR , RLEP .
    o Generate N events according to Luminosity ,calling the generator 
    interface routine ASKUSE as usual.
    o  After event generation , call the generator interface routine USCJOB,
    edit histograms if any and store them on a file if required.
    o Close run properly and make everything ready for the next Energy point.

.f HNOC suppressing cumulated histograms

      When running in standard mode ,histograms are printed out at the end of 
    the job. Furthermore ,if a card HSTO is provided,a histogram file is
    created according to user's specification as given on the Data card.
       When running in Energy scan mode , the user may want to look at the
    histograms after each Energy point or only at the end of the scan.
    By default histograms are printed out only at the end of job, all 
    histograms from the Energy scan being added.   
       One may switch off this action by adding a card  HNOC  to suppress
    cumulated histograms.

1. Format

     The card has no argument , just give : HNOC

2. Action
     Histograms are printed out after each Energy point of the scan and then
     reset. If the HSTO card is there, a file of histograms is created for
     each energy with the name given by the user except that the first three
     characters are replaced by Enn where nn is the scan point number 01,02...

.f NREF using a predefined setup of generator parameters stored in the Data Base

      In order to avoid as much as possible to end up with MC data sets
      generated in so many different configurations that it is more confusing 
      than helpful ,one can use predefined setups of parameters which are
      stored in the Data Base.

      They can be accessed through a special data card NREF followed by the
      setup number to be used .
      The usage of NREF card is recommended for production jobs.
      The card file has to be organised in two sections :
      o a first section containing NREF card and steering data cards,ending
       with an ENDQ card,
      o a second section starting with KCAR with specific cards to modify the
       existing setup and define Energy , cuts, ... as needed and ending with
       a END$ card. 

        Here follows an example :

 *---   First section : steering
 NREF 9604       ! loads setup 9600 and 9604 from Data Base
 RUN    318 'PYTHIA 5.7 RUNNING PHOTOPRODUCTION' ! RUN # , RUN'S TITLE

 * 0.25 radians == cos(theta)=0.97
 TKCUT    0     0.28
 * Minimum mass for gamma-gamma production, do not go below 3. GeV
 GGEM 3.5
 *   any card like MSTJ,PARJ,GADM,GMOB will supersede existing similar card
 *   from the predefined setup
 END$

   The NREF card will trigger the readout from the Data Base of KREF ,NR=9600
  (general setup) and KREF, NR=9604 ( specific setup to this generation)
   Any card appearing after the KCAR card will supersede the values already
  loaded . Those last cards will appear as a Run header bank in the file ( bank
  KCAR ).
   The Generator code number is modified as :
           10000*NREF+ original generator code ,
  so you may know afterwards which NREF card was used ( it appears in the bank
  KRUN).
 
   Predefined existing setups are :

 LEP I : to be used within HVFL programs

   NREF 1         corresponding to HVFL03 set up for 1992 MC production ( JETSET 7.3 mod = JETSET7b)
   NREF 2         corresponding to HVFL04 set up for 1993 MC production ( JETSET 7.3 mod = JETSET7b)
   NREF 3         corresponding to HVFL05 set up for 1994 MC production ( JETSET 7.4)
   NREF 4         corresponding to HVFL06 set up for new LEP I MC production ( JETSET 7.4)

 LEP II : to be used with most LEP II generators

    1996 set up  (JETSET 7.4)

.f KINE/VERT/KHIS

   Those are the 4-momenta of the particle and vertices generated which are later 
   (by programs GALEPH,JULIA,ALPHA...) transformed into FKIN/FVER.
   There is one KINE bank per particle and one VERT bank per vertex.
   KHIS contains the history information ( relation mother to daugther).
   This information follows most often the JETSET convention, generators
   with another convention (like HERWIG) are identified by a non zero value in
   the hundred digit of the generator code ( HRWG10 code 5136).

                  handle concatenated files in input stream
                  better hadling of Run headers : change or not the Run number according to the new RUN card,
                  update RUN comments
                  fix a bug related to POT input
                  preserve KZFR/FZFR bank in Bose EInstein option
                  prepare for qqbar input
      
    version 102 : add version number and released date 
    1 August 2000 increase substantially program speed
                  accept qqbar as input for BE studies

    version 103 : correct for displaced vertices from B0's in HERWIG option
    26 September 2000

    version 104 :  handle low mass Z/gamma* system  in HERWIG option
    5 October 2000 reset primary vertex time in HERWIG option
 
    version 105 :  better handling of ARIADNE setup when option choosen
   23 October 2000 new routine ARJTMD ( data cards MSTV,PARV,MSTG,PARG)
                   new option for Color reconnection models within Jetset: possibility to add a boost
                   to the W+W- system before computing overlap ( add 10 to option =1,2,3 )

    version 106 :   HIST card to store histograms in a file
  24 November 2000  "copy" version to produce the KINGAL output from any POT/DST file
                          active if ipsho=1, ireco=0, ibe=0

    version 200 :  NEW version for interface to HERWIG 6.2
  18 December 2000 new data cards are necessary ( change in HERWIG data cards)

    version 202 :  new implementation of the Color reconnection scheme in JETSET : the reference event is
  13 March 2001    kept unchanged as far as the parton shower is concerned. Then color reconnection is forced 
                   in every event for the SKI model, done according to scheme for SKII and SKII' 
                   For the HERWIG 6.2 option (ipsho = 13), read setup from a file depending on Color reco option:
                   READ '/afs/cern.ch/aleph/reference/kin/herwig62_nocr.cards | CARD'  ! CR Off
                    or
