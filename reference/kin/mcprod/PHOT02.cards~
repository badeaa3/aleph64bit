*      -1 :a new map is created but not written out.
*  When a map is read in , all variables controlling the physics which
*  may have been set by another card are overwritten. This ensures that
*  events are generated with the same conditions as  used in  the  map
*  generation  step.Failure to do so would produce erroneous results.
*  When  generating the map do not ask for events at the same time,
*  better do it in the second step when reading the map back.
* IHIS   1 (ON) or 0 (OFF),if 'ON'then histograms are booked and filled.
* ITYPE    type of physics process choosen with following convention:

*     200    = User defined resonance production, requires GRES card
* EBEAM  Beam energy in GEV/c
* WMIN   minimum invariant mass of final state to be generated
* AMASS  mass of the required final particle (if 0 default from LUND will
*        be used. Ignored for VDM.
* IPPART control flag to print PART bank (1=print out, 0= no print out)

*  Further control for the VDM fragmentation.
*  PTVDM    exponent for the Pt distribution
*  If IWVDM  is 1 then a cross section constant with W is generated.
*  If IWVDM is 2 then a cross section with a 1/W dependance is generated
*  If IPLUTO is 1 then PLUTO style is used ( two quarks in final state )
*                      otherwise RHORHO style ( four quarks )

*       1 At least one electron between TMIN and TMAX(rad )('SINGLE TAG')

* TMIN    Minimum tag angle in radians , used when ICUT= 1 or 2
* TMAX    Maximal tag angle in radians used when ICUT = 1 or 2.
* The angle theta is measured between the electron's original direction
* and its scattered direction.

* IF CARD IS PRESENT LUSHOW IS CALLED
* IQMAX   CHOICE OF QMAX ( SCALE FOR SHOWER )
*      0  USE PT SCALE OF INTERACTION - SJOSTRANDS RECOMENDATION
*      1  USE W OF FINAL STATE - 'MODEL A' - FITS DATA BUT IT'S NOT VDM !

* Control for integration steps of BASES
*
*   NCALL : CONTROLS HOW MANY TIMES BASES LOOPS ROUND IN ONE ITERATION
*   ITMX1 : CONTROLS NUMBER OF ITERATIONS FOR 'GRID DEFINING' STEP
*           INCREASE THESE TWO NUMBERS TO IMPROVE ACCURACY OF MONTE CARLO
*            ESPECIALLY FOR E+E- FINAL STATE.
*   ITMX2 : CONTROLS NUMBER OF ITERATIONS FOR  CROSS SECTION CALC. STEP
*   ACC1  : ACCURACY REQUIRED IN STEP 1 ( STOPS IF ACHIEVED )
*           EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE ERROR ( THE COLUMN HEADED ACC WHEN
*           BASES IS RUNNING ) I.E. ACC1 = 1.0 MEANS STOP IF
*           ACCUMULATED ERROR IN GRID DEFINITION IS 1 PERCENT.
*   ACC2  : ACCURACY REQUIRED IN STEP 2 ( STOPS IF ACHIEVED )
*           EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE ERROR ( THE COLUMN HEADED ACC WHEN
*           BASES IS RUNNING ) I.E. ACC2 = 1.0 MEANS STOP IF
*           ACCUMULATED ERROR IN CROSS SECTION CALCULATION IS 1 PERCENT.
*
* Requesting poor accuracy (i.e. ACCn large ), and/or small number of
* iterations and low number for NCALL produces a  quick and rough answer.
* For precision results increase ITMXn, and NCALL, and decrease ACCn.
* The map will then take longer to generate though ! Note BASES will also
* give up if it is not achieving any significant imprevement between
*  steps, of if it runs out of time.
