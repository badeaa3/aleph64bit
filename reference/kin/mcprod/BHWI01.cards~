* KEYWGT    : switch for constant, variable weight WTMOD:
*             =0 WTMOD=1 useful for apparatus Monte Carlo,
*             To make it more efficient the user may need
*             to adjust a value of WTMAX in routine BHWID1
*             =1 WTMOD varying, faster/safer, RECOMMENDED
*             Try both options for KEYWGT, result should be the same
* KEYRND    : =1,2 type of random number generator RANMAR,RANECU
* KEYEWC    : switching ON/OFF weak corrections:
*             =0 only QED corrections included
*                (here both KeyLib =1,2 should be equivalent)
*             =1 all ElectroWeak Corrections included
* KEYLIB    : option for ElectroWeak Corrections Library:
*             =1 ElectroWeak Corr. from BABAMC (obsolete)
*             =2 ElectroWeak Corr. from ALIBABA, RECOMMENDED
* KEYMOD    : type of MODEL subprogram and QED matrix element
*             for hard bremsstrahlung:
*             =1 obtained by the authors (helicity amplitudes)
*             =2 from CALKUL, Nucl. Phys. B206 (1982) 61.
*             Checked to be in a very good agreement!
* KEYPIA    : photon vacuum polarization switch:
*             =0 OFF,
*             =1 ON, Burkhardt et.al. 1989, as in BHLUMI 2.0x
*             =2 ON, S. Eidelman, F. Jegerlehner, Z.Phys.C(1995)
*             =3 ON, Burkhardt and Pietrzyk 1995 (Moriond).
*             NOTE: Now it works for both ALIBABA and BABAMC
*             routines as well as for KEYEWC=0!
