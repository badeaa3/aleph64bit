      | DALI makes use of linear and non    |     |
      | linear projections in 2D and 3D.    |     |
      | It runs on the following platforms: |     |
      | VMS: VAX, ALPHA                     |     |
      | UNIX: ALPHA, HP, SGI, Linux         |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | The DALI menu acts on the DALI      |     |
      | program through clicking on         |     |
      | command lines.                      |     |

      | The program is split up into        |     |
      | separate modules, called            |     |
      | processors. Whenever you change a   |     |
      | processor via the menu or via the   |     |
      | command language the main page of   |     |
      | the new processor is automatically  |     |
      | displayed.                          |     |

      | DALI was conceived by H.Drevermann, |     |
      | who also wrote the main parts of    |     |
      | the program. B.S.Nilsson wrote the  |     |
      | basic graphics package.The manual   |     |
      | was written by H.Drevermann.        |     |

      | The manual is nearly identical      |     |
      | to the DALI help menu (DALI menu).  |     |
      | Whereas the WWW manual is only      |     |
      | used to browse through and          |     |
      | search for special features,        |     |
   Y  | the DALI menu ACTS on the DALI      |     |
      | program through clicking onto       |     |
      | command lines.                      |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | The program is split up into        |     |
   R  | separate PROCESSORS, which          |     |
      | correspond to chapters in the       |     |
      | manual. The chapters may have       |     |
      | sections or subsections, each of    |     |
      | them filling a page. In the WWW     |     |
      | you find the name of the page in    |     |
      | [] at the top of the page, in the   |     |
      | DALI manual in the right corner     |     |
      | on top of the section.              |     |
      | The first 2 letters are short for   |     |
      | the processor, the third to         |     |
      | identify the section.               |     |
      | This actual page is called INM.     |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | In DALI you are lead to a page      |     |
      | using the page processor, which     |     |
      | you can reach via the menu from     |     |
      | the Top Level or via a sequence of  |     |
      | commands, e.g. to get this page:    |     |

      |                                     |     |
      | DALI consists of many modules,      |     |
      | about 60, which are called          |     |
   Y  | PROCESSORS.                         |     |
      | There are interactive processors    |     |
      | (e.g. FI, EV, YX), with             |     |
      | which the operator can interact     |     |
      | either via the help menu or the     |     |
      | command language                    |     |
      | and there are noninteractive        |     |
      | processors (e.g. RN, RW),           |     |
      | which are just executed.            |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | Examples of processors are:         |     |
      | Read event,                         |     |
      | Draw Y/X projection,                |     |
      | Store picture on PostScript,        |     |
      | Define data to be drawn,            |     |
      | Define colors of data,              |     |
      | etc..                               |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | You get a processor by going        |     |
      | to the top level and calling from   |     |
      | there the processor.                |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | To each processor corresponds a     |     |
      | chapter in the DALI menu. As most   |     |
      | chapters are too long to be         |     |
      | displayed on the screen, they are   |     |
      | split into pages.                   |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | Commands may be given through       |     |
      | clicking or as commands from the    |     |
      | terminal. The commands are unique   |     |
      | per processor, but the same         |     |
      | command word may have a different   |     |
      | meaning in different processors.    |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | Any command defined for a special   |     |
      | processor can be given on the       |     |
      | terminal, independent from the      |     |
      | presently shown page in the help    |     |
      | menu.                               |     |

      | The Top Level Processor allows to   |     |
      | select all other processors. It is  |     |
      | reached from anywhere by typing     |     |
      | "GT" or "GO" (= go to or get) or by |     |
      | clicking on the first row of the    |     |
      | menu:                               |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | Top Level                           |     |
      |                                     |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | When activating noninteractive      |     |
      | processors, DALI returns after      |     |
      | executing to the last interactive   |     |
      | processor from where the operator   |     |
      | was calling.                        |     |
      |                                     |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | When the Top Level Processor is     |     |
      | activated from DALI it is split     |     |
      | into 2 pages. The first page is     |     |
      | shown by default, the second must   |     |
      | be selected interactively:          |     |
      | " continue Top Level "              |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | With <CR> or "GB" you return to the |     |
      | last processor.                     |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | If you use the command language     |     |
      | you may shortcut the Top Level      |     |
      | Processor by typing "GG" and the    |     |
      | name of the processor (e.g. GG:XY). |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | When DALI is started you are guided |     |
      | through several processors, where   |     |
      | you are asked to define the user    |     |
      | level and the name of the input     |     |
      | file. The "guided tour" ends in the |     |
      | event processor, from there you can |     |
      | reach the Top Level Processor.      |     |

  2Y  | The LOGFILE DALI.LOG contains       |     |
  2   | control characters. If you want to  |     |
  2   | read it with an editor it must be   |     |
  2   | converted.                          |     |

  2   |                                     |     |
  2   | You can now edit the converted      |     |
  2G  | file DALI.LOF on another window.    |     |
  2   | A new DALI.LOG is started, so that  |     |

      | There are 4 projections, which can  |     |
      | be used to visualize the region     |     |
      | close to the primary vertex:        |     |
      | YX, YZ, RO, TD.                     |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | In YX, YZ or RO you have to         |     |
      | define an appropriate area by the   |     |
      | normal rubber band or by the        |     |
      | general 3-point rubber band.        |     |
      | (see page "DEFINE ZOOM AREA")       |     |
      |                                     |     |
      |                                     |     |
   Y *| Y/X PROJECTION                      |YX   |
      |                                     |     |
      | This is the simplest projection,    |     |
      | but vertices are shown only from    |     |
      | one side.                           |     |
      |                                     |     |
   Y *| Y'/Z PROJECTION (difficult to use)  |YZ   |
      |                                     |     |
      | Y' = cos(FI)*Y + sin(FI)*X          |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | In order to see the tracks from a   |     |
      | different (orthogonal) side         |     |
      | compared to Y/X, phi (FI) must      |     |
      | be properly defined, i.e.           |     |
      | tracks from the origin              |     |
      | should have a maximal angle to the  |     |
      | Z-axis (see paper "Is there a       |     |
      | future to event display" in 1992    |     |
      | CERN school of computing, Aquila or |     |
      | from ALEPH secreteriat).            |     |
      |                                     |     |
   Y *| RO PROJECTION (most powerful)       |RO   |
      | normally called 3D projection,      |     |
      | which allows to rotate the picture  |     |
      | around a given axis.                |     |
      | The rotation angle around this      |     |
      | axis is called alpha. In order to   |     |
      | see the vertex from 2 (orthogonal)  |     |
      | sides, two views with alpha and     |     |
      | alpha+90 must be used.              |     |

      | Comment:                            |     |
      | The Rho/Z (RZ) projection, which is |     |
      | very powerful further out, cannot   |     |

      | There are pictures on the DALI      |     |
      | window. If you are at the start     |     |
      | one big square window (WS)          |     |
      | and two small ones on the right     |     |
      | above (W5) and below (W6) are       |     |
      | displayed.                          |     |
      | Starting at the center in WS and    |     |
      | working outwards you find the ALEPH |     |
      | detector structure:                 |     |
   R  | the vertex detector (VDET) followed |     |
   R  | by the Inner Tracking Chamber (ITC) |     |
      | (the inner circles), then the       |     |
   R  | Time Projection Chamber (TPC) with  |     |
      | white outlines for each sector.     |     |
      | The electromagnetic Calorimeter     |     |
   R  | (ECAL) is shown in green and the    |     |
      | superconducting coil in blue. The   |     |
   R  | Hadronic Calorimeter (HCAL)         |     |
      | is bright red with two layers of    |     |
   R  | muon chambers (MDET) at the end.    |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | If you want to select and modify    |     |
   C  | projections you must GET them:      |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | There exist shortcut-commands,      |     |
      | with which you select a certain     |     |
   G  | projection and the 'BA ========='   |     |
      | command line on the top of each     |     |
      | page brings you back to the page    |     |
      | you are calling from, in this case  |     |
      | the "beginners page".               |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | Try the following:                  |     |
     *| Selects the projection on the large |GS   |
      | square window.                      |     |
     *| Selects the projection on window 5  |G5   |
     *| Selects the projection on window 6  |G6   |
      |                                     |     |
      | The corresponding DALI help menu    |     |
      | is displayed for further            |     |
      | information or modifications.       |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | Remember:                           |     |
      | The GT command brings you to the    |     |
      | top level, from where you are able  |     |

      | In DALI projections are labeled by  |     |
      | ordinate(Y)/abcissa(X).             |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | Instead of Y/X (YX) one can also    |     |
      | use the phi/rho (FR) projection,    |     |
      | which is usually known as "R-Phi"   |     |
      | with the same features as YX.       |     |
      | YX and FR are the only projections, |     |
      | where transverse momentum can be    |     |
      | estimated unambigously.             |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | Starting at the center following    |     |
      | data can be shown:                  |     |
      | R-Phi hits of VDET, ITC, TPC, ECAL  |     |
      | barrel, HCAL barrel, MDET (barrel   |     |
      | and middle angle) and HCAL tubes.   |     |
      | The HCAL barrel pads are only       |     |
      | shown as histograms, as they are    |     |
      | already summed over rho in the      |     |
      | data. Furthermore, tracks from the  |     |
      | FRFT BOS BANK can be displayed.     |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | The energy deposit of ECAL and HCAL |     |
      | is shown in histograms, which are   |     |
      | summed over rho and Z. They may     |     |
      | include the data from the endcaps,  |     |
      | which is distributed over several   |     |
      | histogram channels with decreasing  |     |
      | phi resolution.                     |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | Due to the complexity introduced by |     |
      | different positions of the barrel   |     |
      | and middle angle Mdet layers, only  |     |
      | those Mdet layers are drawn, which  |     |
      | have a hit. This may be changed     |     |
      | interactively.                      |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | Close to the primary vertex YX      |     |
      | (not FR) works best to visualize    |     |
      | tracks and their dependence from    |     |
      | VDET.                               |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | The "fish-eye distortion" allows to |     |
      | visualize inner and outer detectors |     |
      | together in a schematic way.        |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | Track extrapolation into ECAL or    |     |
      | HCAL endcaps is impossible in YX.   |     |
      | This can be done for single tracks  |     |
      | in the Y/Z (YZ) projection with a   |     |
      | properly chosen angle phi or in the |     |
      | phi/Z (FZ) projection for all       |     |
      | tracks.                             |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | The orthogonal view to YX is the    |     |
      | rho/Z (RZ) projection. Close to the |     |
      | primary vertex, where RZ fails, YZ  |     |
      | with a properly chosen angle        |     |
      | depending on the track or jet       |     |
      | direction should be used.           |     |

   G  | ALL DETECTOR UNITS may be shown     |     |
   R  | separately; EXCEPT the HCAL TUBES,  |     |
      | for which rho cannot be calculated. |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | For the cylindrical ALEPH           |     |
      | detector the Rho/Z projection is    |     |
   Y  | EQUIVALENT TO A CUT through the     |     |
      | center parallel to the beam axis.   |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | For the display of the event the    |     |
      | distance rho from the beam axis     |     |
      | may be negative or positive,        |     |
      | depending on the azimuth phi of     |     |
      | the data. The border between        |     |
      | positive and negative rho can be    |     |
      | interactively adjusted. This        |     |
      | projection is a non linear          |     |
      | "schematic" projection, which is    |     |
   Y  | often called "SIDE VIEW" in         |     |
      | contrast to the front view Y/X.     |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | Considering the spherical           |     |
      | structure of events                 |     |
   Y  | the two projections Y/X AND RHO/Z   |     |
   Y  | ARE SUFFICIENT for an unbiased      |     |
      | examination of the event.           |     |
      | (see Ref.1/chapter 4.5)             |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | Due to the homogeneous magnetic     |     |
      | field parallel to the z-axis        |     |
      | tracks are curved in Y/X.           |     |
      | They are straight in Rho/Z,         |     |
      | if their momentum is not too low.   |     |

      | A square region of the picture is   |     |
      | shown on the selected window. The   |     |
      | aspect ratio is conserved. The      |     |
      | square region cannot be rotated in  |     |
      | itself so that directions are       |     |
      | conserved as well. Center position  |     |
      | and size are defined by the angle   |     |
      | phi (Fi) and from where (FR) to     |     |
      | where (TO) the region extends       |     |
      | radially. FI, FR and TO may be set  |     |
      | by rubber band:                     |     |

      | A rectangular region is shown on    |     |
      | the selected window. The middle     |     |
      | axis of the rectangle points to the |     |
      | center. The aspect ration (AS),     |     |
      | and angles are not conserved. By    |     |
      | setting AS=1, aspect ratio and      |     |
      | angles are conserved but not        |     |
      | absolute directions. Direction and  |     |
      | size are defined by the angle phi   |     |
      | (Fi), the aspect ratio (AS) and     |     |
      | from where (FR) to where (TO) the   |     |
      | region extends radially. FI, AS,    |     |
      | FR and TO may be set via rubber     |     |
      | band:                               |     |
  3   | Point 1 =  phi  + Rmax.             |     |
  3   | Point 2 = width + Rmin.             |     |

   R  | GENERAL LINEAR TRANSFORMATION (ZB)  |     |
      | A general linear transformation     |     |
      | can be defined by transforming a    |     |
      | randomly oriented parallelogram     |     |
      | onto a selected window. The         |     |
      | parallelogram is defined by three   |     |
      | of its corners by the rubber band   |     |
      | band.                               |     |

      | These equations are used to draw    |     |
      | the V if ZOOM MODE is selected and  |     |
      | the LEFT BUTTON is pushed which     |     |
      | leads to curved V's for low energy  |     |
      | tracks. The V is drawn down to      |     |
      | rho=0 (vertex), so that the length  |     |
      | of the arms varies. But MOVE        |     |

      | This projection shows the data in   |     |
      | an abstract form, but with optimal  |     |
      | separation of the hits. It can only |     |
      | be applied to 3D data, for which    |     |
      | phi and theta can be calculated,    |     |
      | like data from the ITC, TPC, ECAL   |     |
      | and HCAL. This projection is based  |     |
      | on the projective construction      |     |
      | principle of ALEPH.                 |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | The powerful technique of the       |     |
      | V-plot can be applied to tracks     |     |
      | and to TPC hits. The information    |     |
      | of hit to track association is NOT  |     |
      | used. On a phi/theta projection     |     |
      | each coordinate is plotted twice,   |     |
      | namely to the left and to the       |     |
      | right of the phi/theta position of  |     |
      | the hit or track coordinate. The    |     |
      | distance between the two positions  |     |
      | is proportional to the outer        |     |
      | border of the TPC. Therefore the    |     |
      | tip of the V indicates, where the   |     |
      | track leaves the TPC. The up- or    |     |
      | downward direction of the V         |     |
      | indicates the particle charge. The  |     |
      | gradient of the arms of the V is    |     |
      | proportional to the (total)         |     |
      | particle momentum. V's with large   |     |
      | opening angle are due to high       |     |
      | momentum tracks. V's with curved    |     |
      | arms are due to low momentum        |     |
      | particles or to tracks, which do    |     |
      | not originate from the primary      |     |

     *| ====================== BACK to last |ba   |
     *| Command list 1 (main)               |\1   |
     *| Command list 2                      |\2   |
      |                                     |     |
      | The horizontal lines show the rho-  |     |
      | phi hits, the vertical lines the    |     |
      | rho-z hits. As theta is shown       |     |
      | instead of z the vertical lines     |     |
      | are slightly curved. All hits of    |     |
      | the same module may have the same   |     |
      | colour or they may have the color   |     |
      | of the associated track.            |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | The vertex hits can be correlated   |     |
      | to the TPC tracks (hits) by the     |     |
      | use of the V-plot:                  |     |
     *|  draw layer 1 or                    |FR=V1|
     *|  draw layer 2 and                   |FR=V2|
     *|  draw the V of TPC hits/tracks      |TO=TP|
      |                                     |     |
      | As the extrapolation of hits alone  |     |
      | to the vertex is difficult by eye   |     |
      | due to the use of angles (phi,      |     |
      | theta), it is recommended to draw   |     |
      | tracks with or without TPC hits:    |     |
     *|       "GT:DD:HT:JU:GB:"             |GG:DD|
      | In this case the tip of the V ends  |     |
      | at the selected layer. As the       |     |
      | layers are not cylindrical this     |     |
      | gives rise to a small error visible |     |
      | only when zooming strongly and      |     |
      | displaying tracks. To estimate the  |     |
      | error the tracks are drawn twice:   |     |
      | to the nearest and to the farest    |     |
      | distance (rho) of the modul.        |     |
      |                                     |     |
  3   | A scale [mm] can be drawn: move the |     |
  3   | cursor to the position where the    |     |
  3   | vertical and horizontal scales      |     |
  3  *| shall cross. Then Type: "SV".       |SV   |
  3   | Large scale bars: 10 mm distance    |     |

      |                                     |     |
      | The rho/phi projection is very      |     |
      | similar to the y/x projection.      |     |
      | It is especially useful to draw     |     |
      | inner and outer subdetectors        |     |
      | together (e.g. ITC and TPC).        |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | This projection transforms          |     |
      | helix segments, which pass          |     |
      | through 0,0 into straight lines     |     |
      | with a gradient inversely           |     |
      | proportional to the transverse      |     |
      | momentum.                           |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | From inside to outside the          |     |
      | following data may be shown:        |     |
      | R-PHI hits of VDET, ITC, TPC, ECAL  |     |
      | barrel, HCAL barrel and MDET        |     |
      | (barrel and middle angle) and the   |     |
      | HCAL tubes.                         |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | Rho/Phi is very useful to check the |     |
      | extrapolation of tracks to the ITC. |     |
      | It allows to zoom single tracks     |     |
      | via the "general linear             |     |
      | transformation" to such an extent,  |     |
      | that the measuring errors of the    |     |
      | TPC get visible.                    |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | Due to the complexity introduced by |     |
      | different positions of the barrel   |     |
      | and middle angle Mdet layers, only  |     |
      | those Mdet layers are drawn, which  |     |
      | have a hit. This may be changed     |     |
      | interactively.                      |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | Track extrapolation into ECAL or    |     |
      | HCAL endcaps is impossible in       |     |
      | Rho/Phi.                            |     |
      | This can be done for single tracks  |     |
      | in the Y/Z (YZ) projection with a   |     |
      | properly chosen angle phi or in the |     |
      | Phi/Z (FZ) projection for all       |     |
      | tracks.                             |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | Rho\Phi cannot be used to           |     |
      | visualize tracks close to the       |     |
      | primary vertex and their dependence |     |
      | from the VDET.                      |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | The orthogonal view to Rho/Phi is   |     |
      | the Rho/Z (RZ) projection.          |     |
      | Close to the  primary vertex,       |     |
      | where RZ fails, YZ with a           |     |
      | properly chosen angle depending     |     |
      | on the track or jet direction       |     |
      | should be used.                     |     |

      | The phi/z (FZ) projection           |     |
      | transforms helices into straight    |     |
      | lines with a gradient inversely     |     |
      | proportional to the longitudinal    |     |
      | momentum, as long as the helices    |     |
      | pass through 0,0. Helices of        |     |
      | tracks with only small multiple     |     |
      | scattering are seen as a group of   |     |
      | parallel lines each representing    |     |
      | one turn of the spiral.             |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | The VDET and the ITC are not        |     |
      | displayed as their data cannot be   |     |
      | separated from the TPC data. The    |     |
      | same is true for data from the      |     |
      | calorimeter barrels.                |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | Contrary to y/x and rho/phi this    |     |
      | projection allows to visualize the  |     |
      | calorimeter endcaps and allows to   |     |
      | extrapolate tracks into the         |     |
      | endcaps from the "phi side". All    |     |
      | tracks of an event are seen from    |     |
      | the "phi side" simultaneously.      |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | This projection is also used to     |     |
      | display the layers of the VDET. We  |     |
      | will split off this part into a     |     |
      | special VDET projection, when we    |     |
      | have time.                          |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | The orthogonal view to FZ is the    |     |
      | Rho/Z (RZ) projection.              |     |

      | A rectangular region of the picture |     |
      | is shown on the selected window:    |     |
      | Vertically defined by FI (starting  |     |
      | point) and DF (extension).          |     |
      | Horizontally the FR and TO values   |     |
      | define the z-range.                 |     |
      | The positioning of the zoom box     |     |

      | is given by theta (TE). That means  |     |
      | with one set of values for FR and   |     |
      | TO one gets two different zoom      |     |
      | areas, depending on TE.             |     |

      | A general linear transformation     |     |
      | can be defined by transforming a    |     |
      | randomly oriented parallelogram     |     |
      | onto a selected window. The         |     |
      | parallelogram is defined by three   |     |
      | of its corners by the rubber band   |     |
      | band. Specially useful is a         |     |
      | parallelogram with one side         |     |
      | parallel to the phi axis.           |     |

      | In the slang of physicists this     |     |
      | projection is called 3D, even if    |     |
      | hits and tracks are normal 2D       |     |
      | projection and their "depth" can't  |     |
      | be infered from the picture. As the |     |
      | data of all subdetectors fall onto  |     |
      | the same region in the picture,     |     |
      | only TPC hits and tracks can be     |     |
      | visualized.                         |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | The direction from wich one views   |     |
      | the data is commonly visualized by  |     |
      | showing the TPC cylinder.           |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | This projection is especially       |     |
      | usefull to visualize track          |     |
      | correlations (possible secondary    |     |
      | vertices) close to the interaction  |     |
      | point. In this case                 |     |
      | one of the relevant outgoing        |     |
      | tracks (the jet to which the        |     |
      | relevant tracks belong) should be   |     |
      | chosen as axis.                     |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | The view point of this projection   |     |
      | is calculated in a way that one     |     |
      | looks perpendicular onto the axis,  |     |
      | which lies horizontally in the      |     |
      | picture plane.                      |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | Around this axis the picture may    |     |
      | further be rotated. In the case     |     |
      | that one is close enough to the     |     |
      | center so that tracks may be        |     |
      | approximated by straight lines a    |     |
      | smooth continuous rotation is       |     |
      | available on all workstations.      |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | The space position of tracks may    |     |
      | be more easily understood by use    |     |
      | of the "artificial cube". However   |     |
      | this method fails for tracks,       |     |
      | which do not precisely originate    |     |
      | from the primary vertex.            |     |

      | TO, DY, and AS.                     |     |

      | A square region of the picture is   |     |
      | shown on the selected window. The   |     |
      | aspect ratio is conserved. The      |     |
      | square region cannot be rotated in  |     |
      | itself so that directions are       |     |
      | conserved as well. Via the rubber   |     |
      | band a rectangle is defined by      |     |
      | two opposite corners and is         |     |
      | symmetrically expanded to yield a   |     |
      | square.                             |     |

      | In the Y'/Z (YZ) projection the     |     |
      | event is viewed perpendicular to    |     |
      | the beam axis, which hence lies in  |     |
      | the picture plane.                  |     |
      | Y' depends on phi (FY) :            |     |
      |                                     |     |

      |                                     |     |
      | The VDET and the ITC data cannot    |     |
      | be separated from the TPC data.     |     |
      | For that reason they are not        |     |
      | displayed.                          |     |
      | The same is happening for data      |     |
      | from the calorimeter barrels.       |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | There exist two possibilities       |     |
      | for tracks to be viewed:            |     |
      | The side, from which they look      |     |
      | curved is called phi side           |     |
      | (e.g. Y/X, phi/rho, phi/theta)      |     |
      | and the side, where they            |     |
      | look straight is called theta       |     |
      | side (e.g. rho/z).                  |     |
      | In the Y'/Z projection tracks are   |     |
      | seen from the phi side, if they     |     |
      | are close to the beam axis and      |     |
      | from the theta side, if the angle   |     |
      | to the beam axis is at maximum.     |     |
      | Hence, via an appropriate choice    |     |
      | of phi (FY) single tracks may be    |     |
      | extrapolated to the calorimeter     |     |
      | endcaps in phi or theta.            |     |
      |                                     |     |
      | As the rho/Z projection fails       |     |
      | close to center, the                |     |
      | Y'/Z projection may serve as        |     |
      | orthogonal projection to Y/X, for   |     |
      | a selected track or a group of      |     |
      | close tracks. For this purpose phi  |     |
      | (FY) must be selected in a way,     |     |
      | that the angle between the tracks   |     |
      | is at maximum.                      |     |

  5   | A general linear transformation is  |     |
  5   | defined through 6 parameters.       |     |
  5   | This is done interactively by       |     |
  5   | measuring 3 points on the picture,  |     |
  5   | which are transformed to the 3      |     |
  5   | corners of the selected window:     |     |
  5   | example:                            |     |

  5   | and move to point 3 without or with |     |
  5   | the middle button pressed. In the   |     |
  5   | latter case a rectangle is drawn.   |     |

  5   | The Puzzle-plot is a special form   |     |
  5   | of the FZ' projetion:  Z'=Z-248.7   |     |
  5   | [cm]. For each pad with energy      |     |
  5   | deposit, 1 vertical line and 3      |     |
  5   | horizontal lines are drawn with a   |     |
  5   | (black) point at the intersections  |     |
  5   | of the vertical line with the       |     |
  5   | horizontal ones.                    |     |
  5   |                                     |     |
  5   | The position of the lines is a      |     |
  5   | function of the third coordinate    |     |
  5   | NR (rho).                           |     |
  5   |                                     |     |
  5   | Small rho : lines are drawn left    |     |
  5   | and low.                            |     |
  5   |                                     |     |

  5   | The lines of neighbouring pads with |     |
  5   | identical rho can be visually       |     |
  5   | connected over the border between   |     |
  5   | the pads. If they connect, the      |     |
  5   | pads touch in space.                |     |

  5   |                                     |     |
  5   | Separately for each cluster the     |     |
  5   | lines with R=Ro are drawn a little  |     |
  5   | longer to visualize if the cluster  |     |
  5   | moves up or down. ( Ro = radius of  |     |
  5   | pad with maximum energy.)           |     |

  5   | The energy of each pad (line) is    |     |
  5   | drawn in another colour onto the    |     |
  5   | line. The length is proportional    |     |

     *| ====================== BACK to last |ba   |
  3   | The distance between track pairs is |     |
  3   | derived as follows:                 |     |
  3   | The leading track segments are      |     |
  3   | transformed into a X',Y',Z' system. |     |
  3   | The direction of the Z'-axis is     |     |
  3   |  defined by :                       |     |

  3  *| theta=x                             |TE=x |
  3   | The leading track segments can be   |     |
  3   | expressed by:                       |     |
  3   | X' = X'(Z') and Y' = Y'(Z').        |     |
  3   | For any track pair i,j              |     |
  3   | rho'ij = SQRT( (X'i - X'j)**2 +     |     |
  3   |                (Y'i - Y'j)**2) )    |     |
  3   | is calculated and                   |     |
  3  *| rho'ij / Z' is displayed with       |DO   |
  3   | alternating colors of the 2 tracks. |     |
  3   | The interpretation of this plot is  |     |
  3   | more difficult on a black and white |     |

  3   |                                     |     |
  3   | Most track pairs give a minumum     |     |
  3   | near to the primary vertex.         |     |
  3   | A minimum further out hints to      |     |

  4   | The ALPHA processor allows you to   |     |
  4   | calculate new quantities, e.g.      |     |
  4   | four-vectors, jets ... Pictures of  |     |
  4   | "ALPHA tracks" are created in       |     |
  4   | another processor called: ALPHA     |     |
  4   | projections ("GT:AP").              |     |
  4   |                                     |     |
  4   | In DALI "ALPHA tracks" are called   |     |
  4   | sometimes "objects".                |     |
  4   |                                     |     |
  4Y  | The USER LIST contains all "ALPHA   |     |
  4   | tracks" or a selected set of them.  |     |
  4   | It contains all calculated new      |     |
  4   | "tracks" = objects. Via this list   |     |
  4   | four-vectors to be added are        |     |
  4   | defined or tracks to be locked.     |     |
  4   |                                     |     |
  4   | Via this list objects may be        |     |
  4   | recolored or made invisible or      |     |
  4   | their mass may be modified.         |     |

  2   |  After a CTRL-L and up to a CTRL-R  |     |
  2   |  all command input (not all text!)  |     |
  2   |  from the keyboard or the Help menu |     |
  2   |  will be recorded.                  |     |
  2   |  Attention:                         |     |
  2   |  Only commands following the prompt |     |
  2   |  for 2-letter commands (":") are    |     |
  2   |  recorded.                          |     |
  2   |  After CTRL-R you are asked to      |     |
  2   |  define a key for or give a name    |     |
  2   |  to the macro.                      |     |
  2   |  (The command sequence is analog to |     |
  2   |  the respective command sequence    |     |

  2   |                                     |     |
  2   |  Macro names consist of at most 20  |     |
  2   |  upper case characters, digits, $   |     |
  2   |  and _ (underscore).                |     |
  2   |  A macro is invoked either by       |     |
  2   |  typing @name or by pressing a key, |     |
  2   |  if it has the name of a key.       |     |
  2   |  Possible keys are:                 |     |
  2   |  F7 - F20, E1 - E6, PF1 - PF4,      |     |
  2   |  KP0 - KP9, PERIOD, ENTER, COMMA    |     |
  2   |  and MINUS.                         |     |
  2   |                                     |     |
  2   |  Macros may contain loops (only if  |     |
  2   |  entered in the DALI_xx.MAC file)   |     |
  2   |  within {...} delimiters. Loops may |     |
  2   |  be suspended at breakpoints by a   |     |
  2   |  CTRL-C or CTRL-H.                  |     |
  2   |                                     |     |
  2   |  Macros can call other macros with  |     |
  2   |  certain limitations.               |     |
  2   |                                     |     |
  2   |  You can type CTRL-I or CTRL-? to   |     |
  2   |  get macro status information.      |     |
