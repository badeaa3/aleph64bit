			Documentation for KINRUN
			========================


	KINRUN is an executable to run kingal with your own fortran or and 
your own cards file.



***************
* Version 2.0 *
***************
With this version, you have three ways to use KINRUN.

KINRUN as on VAX
------------------
You run KINRUN without any options, and you answer to the questions.
You can have several fortran files or C files (you give all the name
on one line separate by a space).

(e.g. : kinrun

     *************************************************
     ***********      KINGAL JOB    2.0  ************
     *************************************************

Which generator do you want to use ?  [CR = ]
(e.g. : /users/username/myexec)  : lpww02

Enter the name for the executable that you will create [CR = ]
(e.g. : /users/username/myexec)  : mylpww02

Enter the name of your input  [CR = joel, SPACE = nothing]
(e.g. : /users/username/myinput.input or /users/username/myinput.f)  :  


       *****************************************
       ***  Cards in the current directory   ***
       *****************************************
No match.
no cards found in the current directory

 Enter the name of the KINGAL steering cards [CR = /aleph/kin/kingal.cards]: /aleph/kin/lpww02.cards

Give the list of extra event generator file or LUND if
you want to use also the LUND generator  [CR = n, SPACE = nothing]
(e.g. : /users/username/mygenerator.a)  : /cern/pro/lib/libphotos.a /aleph/kin/libjetset74.a /aleph/kin/ludata74.o

Give the list of extra object files you want to be linked in front of the KINGAL.o  [CR = 121, SPACE = nothing]
(e.g. : /users/username/myobj.o)  :  

 Do you want to use the modified Lund 6.3 routines (y/n) [CR = n] : 


 Do you want to use the debug mode (y/n)? [CR = n]
(only your fortran and the kingal package will be in the debug mode)
(e.g. : n)  : 

 Do you want to submit your job (y/n)? [CR = y]
(e.g. : n)  : 

Generator used = lpww02 
Historian directives =  
KINGAL data cards = /aleph/kin/lpww02.cards 
Program name = mylpww02 
Debud mode = n 
Extra event generator library = /cern/pro/lib/libphotos.a /aleph/kin/libjetset74.a /aleph/kin/ludata74.o 
list of extra .o files =  
do you use modified LUND ? = n 
do you use RANMAR generator ? = y 

 Are these options correct (y/n)? : y

Save these options in [CR = /tmp_mnt/u3/xu/closier/dev/mylpww02.opt]
(e.g. : /users/username/my_kingal.opt) : 

 Do you want to create the binary and run it with these options (y/n)? : n
 Do you want to create the binary  with these options (y/n)? : y

KINRUN with UNIX style
------------------------
You run KINRUN with some options. These options are -help, -f, -F, -o
-m, -c, -C, -g, -h, -s, -e, -j, -k, -l, -G, -d, -a and <generator_name>

Description of each option :
-h : give the way how to use KINRUN


-help : give the way how to use KINRUN

(e.g. : kinrun -help
 Usage : -help
       : [-f fortran_file] [-C card_file] [-k] [-h] [-o object_file]
         [-l library] [-e] [-j] [-c time_limit] [-m machine] [-g]
         [-G generator] [-s] [-d] [-a]
       : -F filename 
       : generator_name
 
Where: 
     -help                   get this help
     -h                      get this help
     -(f)<string>            expected fortran file  (my_fortran.f)
     -(o)<string>            expected object file  (my_objfile.o)
     -(C)ards<string>        expected card file  (my_cards.cards)
     -(d)                    use modified LUND routines
     -(a)                    use RANMAR generator routines
     -(l)<string>            extra event generator
     -debu(g)                the debug options are used to compile
     -(m)achine<string>      machine where you submit your job
     -(c)putim<string>       time limit for the job in batch
     -(G)enerator<string>    generator used
     -(s)ubmit               submit in batch
     -(F)ile<string>         expected filename which contains kingal options


-f : With this option, you must give the name of your fortran file
     that you want to use.
     This option can be forgotten.
     If you want to put two fortran files, you must give two times the
     option -f with the right file.

(e.g. : kinrun -f my_file1.f -f my_file2.f my_exec
kinrun will create my_exec with the fortran file my_file.f.)


-g : With this option, your own code and the kingal package will be
     compiled with the debug option.

-o : With this option, you must give the name of your object file that you
     want to use.
     This option can be forgotten.

(e.g. : kinrun -o my_obj.o my_exec
kinrun will create my_exec with the object file my_obj.o.)


-C : With this option, you must give the name of your cards file that
     you want to use.
     This option can be forgotten and the default is the value of the
     environment variable KINGALCARDS.

(e.g. : kinrun -C my_cards.cards my_exec)


-d : If you specified this option, you will use the modified LUND routines


-a : if you specified this option, you will use the RANMAR generator routine


-l : With this option, you must give the name of your libraries that you
     want to use.


-m : you must give the machine where you want to submit your job after this 
     option


-s : With this option you precise that you want to run your KINGAL job in batch


-c : You must give a number after this option which will be the time limit for 
     your batch job

-G : After this option, you will give the generator that you want to use in 
     your kingal job


<generator_name> : You give the name of a generator and it will use the default
                   file of option which is in /aleph/kin/generator_name.opt

(e.g. : kinrun generator_name )

-F : see below 'KINRUN with a file'


KINRUN with a file
--------------------

-F : This option is used with the name of a file which contains the
     good options.
     This option is used without any other option.

(e.g. : kinrun -F my_kingal.opt
kinrun will read all the informations which are in the file
my_kinagl.opt and runs with them.)


The format of the file 'my_kingal.opt' must be :

my_file.f
/aleph/kin/kingal.cards
my_exec
shift50
100
Kept
/cern/pro/lib/libphotos.a
/aleph/kin/ludata.o
