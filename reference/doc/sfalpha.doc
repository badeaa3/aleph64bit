			Documentation for SFALPHA
			=========================




  This command file builds for you all the script you need to
 run on SHIFT.  What you need to give is a list
 of the filenames and options you want to use. This list is maintained
 in a file, and you can give this filename when you call SFALPHA:

  sfalpha  filename

  This options file has the type .optb, and defaults to sfalpha.optb

 The command file reads the options file if it exists ( if not, you will
 create one from an interactive dialog),
 and prompts you for validation. If you answer NO, then
 it will prompt for each file and option, giving you the default value
 between [ ]. If you answer <return>, then the default value is kept.
 If you answer " "(space), then no file will be taken.
  When you agree on the options, existence and consistency
 of input files will be checked
 with appropriate warnings if things are amiss.
 The values will be saved in a new version of the .optb file.

 If your session has passed the checks,
 a NQS command file is written for you in this directory and
 submited to SHIFT for processing.
 A new, uniquely-named subdirectory will be created on SHIFT
 for each job, so a new binary is always created.

  At the end of the job on SHIFT,
  histogram and NQS job files are sent back to this directory.
