			Documentation for ALFETCH
			=========================


	ALFETCH is an executable to get up to date the EDIR files on
SHIFT.
This script is run every day in the crontab.


ALFETCH checks on CERNVM if the file EDIR.FILELIST on ALSOFT.230 had
changed. If there is any change, this file is fetched and compared
with the previous one which is in /aleph/edir. After the comparaison,
the job deletes or adds the correct EDIR files.
