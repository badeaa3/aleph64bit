.chapter HOW TO RUN A JOB

     To run the program , the first thing to do is to create an object
   file .OBJ or a library file .OLB .  To do so you must define the
   version of the program you want by means of Historian flags :
    INTER             interactive version
    DOC               documentation (in this case the code is suppressed)

.section   Run a job with user application cradle

                       on VAX :

     The command file GAL:GALRUN.COM is intended to prepare several
  kinds of GALEPH jobs in interactive or batch mode.
  To invoke GALRUN :  @ GAL:GALRUN
  then follow the instructions, there is an HELP command for beginners.

                    or on CERNVM :

     Exec GALRUN on GAL minidisk, is intended to prepare several kinds
  of GALEPH jobs in interactive (DEBUG available ) or batch mode. User
  has  to enter his choices through panels (see HELP GALRUN or GALRUN ?.
  To invoke GALRUN just issue the GALRUN command.
  A more detailed description can be obtained by GALRUN HELPCMS.

 PANELS
 ------
     4 panels are available allowing the user to enter parameters .
   The first one is always displayed when invoking GALRUN.  It is used
   to select or create a set of defaults .  The existing user defaults
   sets names are displayed on this panel.  It is possible to select
   an existing default set without going through the other panels :
   the parameters used are those stored by a previous pass.  To remove
   a default set just overwrite some character(s) on the name(s).

     Panel 3 is used for input/output files specifications:
           historian input, data cards, printout file
