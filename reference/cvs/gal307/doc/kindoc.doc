   The kinematics is steered in ASKINE.
   It is possible to generate internally USER type of event,
   for more details look at KINGAL documentation.
   Or to generate a single particle of a given type in a given
   range of momentum and cosine(theta).
   The choice is triggered by data card:

       KINE  'USER'  svx  svy   svz  --- free for user ------------------
       KINE  'PART'  svx  svy   svz  part#   pmin  pmax  cthemin  cthemax

   The smeering of the primary vertex around (0.,0.,0.) is defined by:
       svx, svy, svz
