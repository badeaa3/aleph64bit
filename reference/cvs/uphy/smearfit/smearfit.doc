Track smearing & deletion parameter calculation :

      CALL SMEARFIT(SMBIN, RTBIN,  NMCFIL, MCFILE, NDAFIL,
     +     DAFILE, CAFILE, HIFILE)

     Input :
       CHAR*1   SMBIN     = 'N' no binning in theta/p for smearing.
                          = 'T' binning in theta for smearing.
                          = 'P' binning in p for smearing.
                          = 'B' binning in both theta/p for smearing.
       CHAR*1   RTBIN     = 'N' no binning in theta/p for deletion.
                          = 'T' binning in theta for deletion.
                          = 'P' binning in p for deletion.
                          = 'B' binning in both theta/p for deletion.
       INTE     NMCFIL    = number of MC files
       CHAR*(*) MCFILE(*) = MC file names
       INTE     NDAFIL    = number of data files
       CHAR*(*) DAFILE(*) = data file names
       CHAR*(*) CAFILE    = output card file name
       CHAR*(*) HIFILE    = output histogram file name

This routine will perform the calculation of the smearing and deletion
parameters for QIPBTAG/QSMEAR. The procedure to use this is to run two
ALPHA jobs calling QIPBTAG, with the CALB keyword in the ALPHA card
file: one on the Monte Carlo and one on the data. SMEARFIT takes the
path of the histogram files outputed by QIPBTAG as input and outputs
the smearing/deletion parameters to CAFILE. HIFILE contains histograms
describing the effect of the smearing on the impact parameter
significance.

The bank names created are 'Qxyy' where x = P, T, N, B for momentum
binning, theta binning, none or both, and yy = DE, SM for deletion or
smearing parameters. The bank number will be 100*(VDET setup code) +
i, where i = 1 for Z data, 2 for high energy data, 3 or 4 for
QIPBTAG2.

Note that many analyses apply a cut on the polar angle of the thrust
axis before calling QIPBTAG. In this case, it makes sense to apply
the same cut before calling QIPBTAG when following the instructions
above. If you are producing official smearing/deletion banks for the 
database, then choose typical |cos(theta)| cuts (e.g. 0.8 at LEP1 and
0.9 at LEP2).
