  New routine to identify Lcal clusters
  =====================================
  To match the routine SICLID, identifying a Sical cluster, there
  is now a routine LCALID in the UPHY area identifying a Lcal
  cluster. The calling sequence is shown below. More detailed 
  documentation is found in the header of the routine.

C!    Input:      - iclu = cluster number in bank
C!                  ityp = 1 bank is PECO,
C!                         2 bank is LUPA
C!                        10 bank is PECO - Debug print
C!                        11 bank is LUPA - Debug print
C!    Output:
C!                - iflag quality flag 0 = OK,
C!                                     1= shower starts in Sical
C!                                     2= leakage through back
C!                                     3= leakage through cracks
C!                                     4= shower near dowels
C!                                     5= MIP punch through
C!                                     6= electronic noise
C!                                     7= off mom. beam particle
C!                                     8= spark
C!                                    -1= not a lcal cluster
C!                                    -2= not enough info
C?     Usage:
C?     This routine can be called from ALPHA when reading MINI or
C?     POT. It is applicable to all LEPII data.
C?
C?     In loops over Energyflow objects, itk, the input variable
C?     iclu can be obtained from iclu=KEFOLE(itk).
C?
C?     Clusters with iflag >= 7 can be dismissed - BUT if the general
C?     event kinematics is consistent with gamma-gamma or Z return,
C?     then iflag=7 will certainly be wrong. Beam particles in Lcal
C?     are exceedingly rare.
C?     Clusters with 1 <= iflag <= 6 should be dismissed only if
C?     a precise energy measurement of this particular cluster
C?     is important.
C?     In case of iflag=2, 3 and 6, a correction is already applied
C?     in the energyflow, but iflag=6 is a more efficient noise
C?     filter than the one applied in the energyflow.
C?     For iflag=1, 2 and 4 some of the lost energy may in fact be
C?     picked up by Sical or Hcal.
