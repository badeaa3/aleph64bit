Dear Colleages!

	We are happy to inform you that we have now a tool for access to
the BCAL++ information from ALPHA. (Afterward, we will simply call BCAL++
as BCAL)

-------------
Introduction:
-------------

	For data, BCALINFO first looks for BCAL related banks which
contain PMT, APD and silicon pad ADC information of each module. This
information is used to calculate the energy deposit and the centroid. 

	For MC, since BCAL is not currently simulated inside the official
GALEPH, we make a loop over all the stable MC particle and pass them
through a fast BCAL simulation program including the quadrupole
simulation. The 4-momenta of a reconstructed BCAL object are obtained by
assuming that it is the scattered beam e- (e+). 

------
Usage:
------

	When compiling your ALPHA job, you have to link with the obj file
currently inside /aleph/uphy area (libbcalinfo.a). And, add include path
"/al/reference/cvs/uphy/bcalinfo" in order to include "bcalinfo.h" file.

	Inside QUEVNT, just call BCALINFO(dummy). Once it is called, the
following COMMON variables are filled. COMMON can be taken from
"bcalinfo.h" file in /al/reference/cvs/uphy/bcalinfo.

KNBCR	- Number of BCAL object	reconstructed (Maximum 4 currently)
KFBCR	- First BCAL object
KLBCR	- Last BCAL object

	You can access physical information via, QE,QP,QCT,QPH,QX,QY,QZ,
etc..  just like any ALPHA track.  Some ALPHA variables like QDB, QZB, and
error matrix are not available. For MC truth, you can access equally by
KNBCT, KFBCT, KLBCT. 

	At this moment, we do not assign any track class to these BCAL
objects, i.e., neither KMONTE nor KRECO, in order not to affect on any
user's routine having some loops on the track class. 

	Here is an example to show how you access BCAL infomation, 

      SUBROUTINE QUEVNT(QT,KT,QV,KV)
C-------------------------------------------------------------------------
C	quevnt
C-------------------------------------------------------------------------
      include '/aleph/phy/qcde.inc'
      COMMON /BCINFO/ KNBCR,KFBCR,KLBCR,KNBCT,KFBCT,KLBCT
      include '/aleph/phy/qmacro.inc'
*
*	calling BCAL stuffs
*
      CALL BCALINFO(dummy)
*
*     	loop on BCAL object to see Q^2 of gamma-gamma scatering
*
      NTAG=0
      DO ITK=KFBCR,KLBCR
        IF (QE(ITK).ge.40.0) THEN	! scattered electron tag
          NTAG=NTAG+1
          Etag=QE(ITK)
          Ctag=QCT(ITK)
        ENDIF
      ENDDO
      IF (NTAG.EQ.1) THEN
        WRITE(*,*)' Single tag event'      
        Q2=2.0*(QELEP/2.0)*Etag*(1.0-Ctag)
      ENDIF
*
*	user routines
*
      RETURN
      END

*

----------
Utilities:
----------

Once after the call BCALINFO, one can also use the following functions.
But besure to declare EXTERNAL.

XBCA(i)		.TRUE. if BCAL reconstruction info. is available
QBCAER(i)	Raw energy (Currently determined by APD)
QBCARC(i)	Radial position of the reconstructed centroid
QBCAPC(i)	Phi (degree) of the reconstructed centroid

KBCALTAG(i)	check a MC particle whether it passes a BCAL module region.
		return the module number, if 0 the particle can not reach
		to the BCAL.

where i is the ALPHA track number.
