.chapter LEVEL 2
.section  INTRODUCTION

  The input to the level 2 trigger is the TPC hit bank TTHT. This is fir
transformed to give the level 2 hit bank X2HF containing the TPC trigger
pad information which is passed through the level 2 simulation. The resu
output are the banks X2MS containing the level 2 mask,and X2TF containing
the angular bins in which a track has been found. The banks X2HF,X2MS and
X2TF are then output to level 3.

.section  GENERAL DESCRIPTION

  The simulation passes the data with the optional addition of added noi
through the look-up tables created for loading into the level 2 processor
memories. Each input data point is placed into one of a number of angular
cells each of which covers part of the TPC volume and points towards the
interaction region. Data are passed to a second stage of processing from
cells with sufficient entries to correspond to a track. The second stage
performs a test on the internal consistency of the data to improve the
efficiency of the system at rejecting noise and background tracks. Cells
containing tracks are then used to set bits in the level 2 trigger mask.
