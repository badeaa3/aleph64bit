.chapter FAST
.section Introduction

   FAST is a private fast tracking package which completely replaces
the GEANT3 tracking and hit generation scheme.  It has been inspired
by the approach developed by the Wisconsin group (J. Hilgart,
M. Mermikides) for LEP 200 studies and intended to be used in conjunction
with the SIMDST package in high statistics physics applications, which
would be prohibitively slow under the standard GEANT3 scheme.

.section Geometry

   The standard GALEPH/GEANT geometry description is used in the
tracking detectors, where the geometrical quantities are derived from
the data base in the conventional way. A geometry description of the
ECAL and HCAL is derived from constants initialized privately via
calls to RSDTBA and FSIRUN (q.v.).
For the purposes of tracking, we consider for now three volumes
which are treated as uniform media: 1) A cylinder defined by the limits
of the active TPC volume where we simulate the response of the tracking
detectors (VD,IT,TP)  2) A volume delimited by the first and last
sensitive planes of the ECAL barrel and endcap modules  3) A cylinder
defined by the limits of the active HCAL volume. The forward
region covered by the luminosity calorimeter and tracking device(SA)
are not impemented yet.

.section Tracking

   Starting from the initial GEANT kinematics tree we define for each
particle a potential path length to the boundary of the TPC fiducial
cylinder, treating the trajectories of charged particles as continuous
helices (ie ignoring multiple scattering and energy loss. Errors on the
hit positions due to these processes can be accounted for afterwards)
Decays in flight are fully impelemented using the standard particle
data table and GEANT tools and the secondary vertices and tracks are
appended to the kinematics structure.  It is intended to implement
gamma conversions in the next version.  To save time we follow
particles trapped within the fiducial volume though one full revolution
only.

   For each charged particle we generate hits in the central tracking
detectors, using a fast private intersection routine and taking account
of geometrical losses. The hits are stored in the standard BOS banks
'VDHT', 'ITHT', 'TPHT'. We can optionally store the track elements 'TPTE'
(Note that there is only one track element per particle in this scheme,
the length corresponding to the distance to the fiducial boundary, the
decay point, or one full revolution, whichever is smaller).

   For particles which escape the TPC fiducial cylinder, we compute the
coordinates at the impact with the first sensitive layer of the ECAL
surface and generate a random path length to the first interaction
point (in the ECAL or HCAL) for hadrons. 'Electromagnetic' particles
are showered 0.5 cm beyond their entrance to the ECAL. We also compute
the ECAL exit point of the
particle or shower. This information is used by the SIMDST package for
shower parametrisation, dE/dX loss, and ultimately, formation of
 AL objects.

.section GALEPH/SIMDST INTERFACE

    The FAST code is impemented by defining the HISTORIAN flags
 FAST and RDST.
