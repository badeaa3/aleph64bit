    GALEPH 24.0 - new version of the geometry
                  introduce FACE 90 and FACE 91, using the setup code.

    ! after number means checked and ok
    ? after number means corrected but doubtful
     blank after number means not checked

     Additional material constants:
     passive face additional electronics and stability ribs are not
     included.

     a note on radii tiltangles etc. (modified 26-11-90)

     We measure a radius for the support:
         r(inner layer) = 6.98964 cm
         r(outer layer) = 10.17346 cm
     we add/subtract 0.6 cm for the aluminium spacers

     The distance of the centre of the Si wafer from the spacers is:
         0.160 cm - 0.0150 cm (half width of Si)
     we keep arbitrairily 0.0280 cm ceramic thickness.
     the total thickness of the face box is:
         separator + ceramics + ceramics + chip = 2600 mu
     where we have set for backward compatibility :
         separator = chip thickness
     The wafers are glued to the ceramics at x=0
     This leads to separator = chip = 1020 mu

     for GEANT we need the radii to the centre of the box ie:
         r(GEANT) inner layer =  6.98964 - 0.6 - 0.145 = 6.24464
                  outer layer = 10.17346 + 0.6 + 0.145 = 10.88796
     we assume here mechanic support 1 in VDME = Munich
                    mechanic support 2 in VDME = Pisa

     The radii defined in COMMON/VDSUPP/ are
         inner layer =   6.98964 - 0.6 = 6.38964
         outer layer =  10.17346 + 0.6 = 10.77346
     they are stored in VDAPLN (Munich/Pisa,inner/outer)
     Tilt angles VMETIL on the data base refer to these radii
     Tilt angles VDTILT calculated in VRDDAF refer to the wafer centre.

     Offset distances from the centre of the wafer to the closest
     point of the wafer to the detector centre (90.0 deg. point)
     is calculated from the drawing to be:
         0.78426  cm (inner layer), 1.18403 cm (outer layer)

     This gives tilt angles (VMETIL) of
         inner layer: 0.12212847 (Munich + Pisa)
         outer layer: 0.10946317 (Munich + Pisa)
     The sign of the tilt is not known, but is the same everywhere
     and probably positive.

     We calculate possible radii for the inner support ring:
         ri=7.4, ro=11.3
     the outer ring is not known

     For VDET 91 the radius and angles for the cf tube position are:
     radius of tube position: VDSPGA(3)=9.
     angle of tube 1/4 from the vertical: +-VDSPSP(3) = 36.0 deg.
     angle of tube 2/3 from the vertical: +-VDSPSA(3) = 24.0 deg.

         As explained elsewhere in this document, relevant routines for
    Minivertex detector are:
    VDIRUN : Initializes all minivertex related variables and routines
             and defines format for banks.
    VDHIT  : Processes single tracking steps.
    VDASIG : Closes the Hits generations and creates the hit bank.
    VDDIGI : Produces digitizing, that is signals on strips.

         Other routines have been implemented to make the job easier:
    VDCRDT : obtain the VDDT bank by sorting up the VDTD one
    VDDAQ  : simulate Data Acquisition chain.
    VADESA : unpack strip address.
    VAENSA : pack strip address.
    VADEWA : unpack wafer address.
    VAENWA : pack wafer address.
    VDFIRS : calculate and store the signals on the strips produced
             by a given hit.
    VDIDIG : initialize variables for the digitization part
    VDINSS : add strips to the digits bank and to the history banks.
    VDNOFS : add noise to fired strip clusters
    VDNOIS : generate noise fired cluster
    VDNOCL : generate noise on a single strip

         In addition to this ones, some printing routines are
    implemented in the ALEPHLIB, namely:
    VDPGEO : print geometrical constants.
    VDPRHT : print contents of hit bank.
    VDPRDI : print digitization banks.

.section Hit generation in VDET
         When the routine VDHIT is called the first time a particle
    enters an active part of detector, the entry point, as long as the
    wafer number and the track number are stored in a work bank (with
    index KHTXVD).
    The data are taken, as usual, from the common /TRKCOM/.
         In the successive steps of tracking the energy release of the
    particle is accumulated in a local variable until the particle
    exits the active zone of the detector.
         In the last step the hit is completed by storing the exit point
    and the total energy release in the work bank.
         When tracking is finished, the routine VDASIG then copies the
    work bank into the named bank VDHT.


.section Digitization in VDET
         Digitization in Minivertex is handled in VDDIGI.

         After some booking and counting, the hits are passed to VDFIRS,
    one at a time. Here read-out geometry is taken into account,
    including dead zones and strip pitch. The hit's coordinates are
    rotated in the wafer plane that at the moment is defined to be
    parallel to the z-axis.
    Charge partition between the strips is done segmenting the track
    in many points and then taking into account diffusion and magnetic
    field effect. The process is done both on the phi and z side.
    vdnofs add noise to the fired strips and their neighbourings,
    through calls to VDNOCL.
    The work bank JDVNOI has three words per row, in the first one
    it is stored the noisy strip adress, in the second the series noise
    contribution in e/pf, in the third one the paralle noise
    contribution in electrons.
    The work bank JDVDAQ has two words per row, in the first one
    it is stored the strip adress read by the data aquisition chain,
    in the second the overall contribution of the noise at the output.
    VDNOIS, if selected through a proper run condition (see below),
    generate noisy hits throughout the all detector.
         The strips produced by a given hit are stored in a local
    array that, at the end of VDFIRS, is passed to VDINSS, to be
    inserted in the digitization bank.

.section Minivertex run conditions.

         The contents of data card RUNC 'VDET' are put in an array
    (ICVDJO) at job initialization time. The first 4 elements are
    reserved for future use in Minivertex physics. The element 6-10
    are used for debugging purposes. They are intended to be used only
    development time and produce quite a lot of printout. In any case
    all WRITE statements are protected with the general debug flag.
    In particular:
        ICVDJO(  1  ) : Bank number of data base GALEPH banks
        ICVDJO( 2-5 ) : Reserved
                 6    : Debug Hits generation.
                 7    : Debug digitization part.
                 8    : control the noise in VDET. the default 0
                        activate only VDNOFS. 1 neither VDNOFS nor
                        VDNOIS, 2 activate both.
                9-10  : to be defined.
