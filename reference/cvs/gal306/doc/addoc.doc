.chapter  DISPLAY          display routines
     This chapter describes the subroutines used by the display option
  of the standard Batch version of GALEPH.
     If the display flag is activated  ,the program will :
   - initialize the display process by calling ADINIT once.
   - produce a capture file on unit LGRAIO (default 3) containing 2 typical cut
     views of the requested events ( call ADVIEW).
     The initial  step will  initialize some  constants  needed by  the drawing
   package ( scale factors , seen or unseen volumes ) by a call to GUINTI.
     Then it will build once the standard views of the event,i.e.
    - one X-Y cut view at Z=0.
    - one Y-Z cut view at X=0.
     In order to save time , those views of the geometrical set-up are built
   once  and  stored  in  view  banks  by  subroutines ADXY  and  ADRZ. They are
   recalled  in  each  event  when  needed.
     The event processing step calls ADVIEW after each event in ASCEVE.
     The display of the tracks is superimposed to the display of the set-up
   in each of the defined cut views,toguether with a picture header and a title.
     In the Y-Z view , R is plotted instead of Y .
