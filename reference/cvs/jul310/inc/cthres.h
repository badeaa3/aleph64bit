      PTLOW = transverse momentum
              below which the association is always kept
      PTHI  = transverse momentum
              below which assoc is kept if hclu energy is below ehlim
      EHLIM = max. energy for a hcal cluster to be associated
      PNMICT = Max distance between Mip track and HC storey
               if they are to be associated
      DLIMCT = MAX ANGLE FOR ECAL-HCAL ASSOCIATION (RAD.)
      EDMUCT = standard calorimetric energy for a muon
