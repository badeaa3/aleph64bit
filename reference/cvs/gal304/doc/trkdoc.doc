.chapter TRACKING
     The tracking is performed by GEANT3.   The  steering  routine  is  GTREVE
  called by ASPEVE.
     Multiple-scattering, energy loss and electromagnetic process are done  by
  GEANT3 packages.
     Hadronic processes are performed by GHEISHA.

     Tracking is performed depending on the type of the particle:
         gamma, electron, charged had., neutral had., muon
     The primary vertex is stored in VERT bank  and  primary  tracks  in  KINE
  banks.
     The secondaries can be stored either in VERT+KINE banks or in STACK bank.
  The user makes the choice.
     A track receives 2 numbers :  a track number IGTRA  and  a  stack  number
  IGSTAK.  When the track belongs to the KINE bank ("primary track") the stack
  number IGSTAK = 0.
     Tracking starts with the first track of the KINE bank and continues  with
  all  tracks stored in the STAK bank until it is emptied .  Then it continues
  with the next track in the KINE bank.
     (look at GEANT3 manual the TRAK chapter for more details)

     Control is given to the user in GUSTEP after a step is performed or  when
  entering a new volume in GTRACK.  At this level a track element is avalaible
  in  the  GEANT  common  block /GCTRAK/, /GCSETS/, /GCKINE/.  Secondaries are
  stored in /GCKING/.

     If the track element is in a selected sensitive volume (IGDTYP>0 and SETS
  data card) and it is a charged particle or a photon in the ECAL, the  common
  /TRKCOM/ is filled in and control is transferred to the corresponding module
  xxHIT,  where  it  can be used in conjonction with the common /GCKING/ which
  contains the secondaries and /GCMATE/ which contains  the  current  material
  parameters.

     Then in case of production of secondaries during the last tracking step ,
  control is transferred to ASKTRK to store  the  secondaries  either  in  the
  standard KINEmatics banks or in a temporary STACK.  The track element can be
  stored in the JGXYZ bank if debug or display of the event is required.

     New tracks are stored in routine ASKTRK:
  PRIMARIES are stored in 'KINE' banks, non primary tracks are stored in
  the stack and loose their identity after the tracking.

    A particle is called a PRIMARY if it is a daughter of a primary and it
  is produced in the inner part of the apparatus (up to the TPC outer wall
  but the TPC endplate and ITC endplate), and its momentum is above 100Mev.
