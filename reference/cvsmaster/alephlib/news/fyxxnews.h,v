@CKEY FYXX MCARLO KINE
C! FYXX package : build FYxx banks (kinematics)
 The FYXX package translates and filters MONTE CARLO tracks from one
 set of banks (KINE,VERT,KHIS,KPOL,KVOL) to another set
 (FKIN,FVER,FPOI,FPOL)  which is more convenient for analysis. A few
 utility routines are also included.
 When the package is used to
 translate KINE etc. to FKIN etc. certain types of 'uninteresting'
 tracks may be dropped: those tracks which originate
 in the ITC electronics or TPC endplate, tracks which originate in
 the calorimiters, and tracks whose momenta are below a certain
 threshold. Certain tracks will be kept regardless of these cuts,
 namely tracks which came from the event generator.

 The FYXX package must be initialized with a call to FYIRUN :
      CALL FYIRUN(0.,TKDRO,SHDRO,CUTRA)
 INPUTS:
       TKDRO       = IF true THEN drop history of interactions
                     in ITC electronics and TPC endplate
       SHDRO       = IF true THEN drop history of interactions
                     in calorimeters
       CUTRA       = IF not 0. THEN drop track with momentum
                     below CUTRA

  and for each event there must be a call to FYKINE :
      CALL FYKINE(DROP,GARB,IBFUL)
 - input arguments :
        DROP     = character flag
                   if = 'DROP' then drop KINE,VERT,KHIS,KVOL,KPOL banks
        GARB     = character flag
                   if = 'GARB' then make a garbage collection
 - output argument :
        IBFUL    = -1 means not enough space in BOS array
