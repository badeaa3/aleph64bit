@C! 1st entry into GAMPACK set
 ! ALEPHLIB 312
    GBULOS : Double precision fixes for Linux                   (D.Smith)
    GFRAC  : Double precision fixes for Linux                   (D.Smith)
             Suppress unused declarations                       (M.Cattaneo)

     CORAD94: Apply correction from EGAZ bank. 
              Switched off if OLGA data card is present  (M-N.Minard)
 ! ALEPHLIB 20.4
   GAMPEX, VOISTO, GIVSTO - add several protections.
 ! ALEPHLIB 204
   GAMPEX, VOISTO, GIVSTO - add several protections.
 ! ALEPHLIB 203
   GAMPEX - Call ECETDI  to correct for gain correction from ECMC
          - New feature added to calculate the probability of
            a Gampex photon to be fake from electromagnetic or
            hadronic origine (GFAKE,GEMFAK,GHAFAK)
   CORAD94- Replace CORADOC for the current version of alephlib
   GAPGAC - Built photon bank PGAC
 ! ALEPHLIB 157
   CORADOC - correct a bug
 ! ALEPHLIB 154
   GXMCLM - add a limit on the cluster energy to be treated
 ! ALEPHLIB 152
   various corrections in CORADOC, GAMPEX, GFRAC, GXIMPA
   for the overlap region
 ! ALEPHLIB 151
   CORADO is purged
   CORADOC - new function CORADOC (EN,TH,PHI)
   GAMPEX  - get run number from ABRUEV to distinguish between
             Real and MC data
             call CORADOC with new argument list
   GAPGID  - bug correction
   MORSTO  - suppress reference to BMACRO
   reintroduce old version for backward compatibility:
   GAMPEK, GATRAL, ISPARK, MECRFC behind *DK VOISTO.
   These decks should be deleted when GAMPEK is no longer used.
   the variable E4ETB in routine DEFOVE keeps the new value 0.851
   instead of the old one 0.85

 ! ALEPHLIB 146 : new version
    main routine is called GAMPEX
      SUBROUTINE GAMPEX(IPECO,EMIGA,LTOTGA,NNGA,GAMVE,GAMCE,IRTFG)
    Input :
             IPECO is the PECO cluster number
             EMIGA is the min. energy for a photon
             LTOTGA is the total length of GAMVE
                    in the user program:
                    GAMVE should be dimensioned to (20,NPHOT) and
                    GAMCE should be dimensioned to (20,NPHOT) and
                    LTOTGA = 20*NPHOT
                    in GAMPEK: GAMVE is dimensioned to (20,*)
                    the maximum number of photons will be: LTOTGA/20
    Output:
