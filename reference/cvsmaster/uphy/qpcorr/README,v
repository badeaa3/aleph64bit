                         Function QPCORR
                        -----------------
 Corrects particle momenta for the effects of residual distortions in
 the central tracking detector.
    This is the so called "sagitta correction".
 It depends upon cos(theta) and the year of data taking.
 
    Author   :  I.R. Tomalin
                Based on subroutine QFBDEV written by I. ten Have,
                and comments from H.Videau and A.Halley.
    Modified :  I.Tomalin 30/1/97.
                Add LEP2 corrections and prepare move to ALEPHLIB.
 
 Motivation:
   Every year, even after the detector alignment is finished and
 corrections have been made for field distortions etc., it is found
 that Ebeam/P in Z0 -> mu+mu- events is not precisely 1, presumably
 because of residual distortions.
   (Typically, in the region |cos(theta)| > 0.9, Ebeam/p is about 0.94
 for +ve tracks and 1.06 for -ve tracks. Elsewhere, Ebeam/p is usually
 consistent with 1 to within a percent or so. The effect is not quite
 forward-backward symmetric).
   The relative bias in momentum is proportional to P, so most people
 analysing hadronic events can ignore it. Exceptions include analyses
 using the ECAL electron identifiers in the region |cos(theta)| > 0.9,
 or analyses which are very sensitive to systematic biases in the
 momenta (e.g. jet charge, tau polarization).
   This routine provides a correction for the momenta based upon
 Ebeam/P measurements in Z0 -> mu+mu- events. It assumes that the
 corrections for -ve and +ve particles are equal in size, but of
 opposite sign. This is observed to be true, apart from a constant
 offset, Ebeam/p = 1.002, which is also present in the MC and so not
 corrected for.
   In principle, the correction depends upon your track selection
 cuts, but providing that the corrections have a small effect on your
 analysis, you can ignore this. Arguement NVDET does correct for this
 to first approximation however.
 
      FUNCTION QPCORR(ITRK,ASCALE,NVDET,ERCORR)

 Input Arguments:
    ITRK    (Integer): ALPHA track number.
    ASCALE  (Logical): Set .TRUE. if ALPHA variables like QX,QY,QZ
                       are to be rescaled by calling QVSCAL.
                       N.B. Don't call this routine twice for the
                       same track with ASCALE = .TRUE. !
    NVDET   (Integer): If your analysis only uses tracks with at
                       least 1 VDET hit, set NVDET=1; otherwise =0.
 Output Arguments:
    QPCORR  (Real)   : Scale factor applied/to be applied to momentum.
    ERCORR  (Real)   : Statistical error on this factor.
 
 If corrections are not available for any year, please contact the 
 tracking group.

   The effect is expected to be proportional to P**2, so most people

   For those needing details: the Z0 -> mu+mu- events analysed used
 FRFT 2 tracks (except in 1990 when FRFT 0 was used), but did not
 require VDET runs in SCANBOOK. Only tracks with > 4 ITC and
 > 5 TPC coords. were used.
