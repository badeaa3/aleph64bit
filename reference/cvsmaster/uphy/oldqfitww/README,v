@                         WW fitting package:  QFITWW

In semi-leptonic (hadronic) decays of WW pairs, 1-C and 2-C (4-C and 5-C) 
fits are available.  The 1-C (4-C) fit imposes four momentum conservation 
while the 2-C (5-C) fit allows the user to define the degree to which the 
equal mass constraint is imposed.  The user provides QFITWW the four 
final state ALPHA track numbers (along with the correct jet assignment 
to the W's) and the desired event type (4jet or 2jlv).  QFITWW then 
returns the respective fitted track numbers along with the two fitted W track 
numbers (and possibly a track number for ISR, if desired).  MIGRAD from MINUIT 
is used to perform the chi-square minimization.  The complete set of the 
parameters associated with the chi-square function may be found in the 
appendix.  Any combination of these parameters may be declared as variable or 
fixed for the fit.  More complete documentation may be found in ALEPH
note ALEPH 96-129/PHYSIC 96-118.

| CALL QFITWW( EVTYP, IOPT, MASTOL, ITKS, IFTKS, ERMAT, CHISQ, ISTAT ) |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Input Arguments:

	CHARACTER*4 EVTYP:
		EVTYP is used to specify the decay channel for the W pair.
		Semi-leptonic channel:	'2jln' or '2jlv'
		Hadronic channel:	'4jet'
		
		Default:  Semi-leptonic channel.
		
	INTEGER IOPT:
		IOPT is an option bit that is used to specify which parameters
		to vary in the fit.  See the appendix for a listing of the 
		order of the parameters and some examples.   
		
		Default:  fit jet and lepton energies for a 2jlv WW event or,
			  fit al jets' energies and angles for a 4jet event
		
	REAL MASTOL:
		MASTOL is the degree (in GeV) to which the WW pair is 
		constrained to have equal masses. If MASTOL=1000.0, then the 
		equal mass constraint term is removed from the chisquare sum
		and QFITWW becomes a 4-C (1-C) fit for the hadronic 
		(semileptonic) channel.  Otherwise, QFITWW is a 5-C (2-C) fit
		for the hadronic (semileptonic) channel.
		
		Default:  the WW pair is constrained to be equal to within 3
		GeV.

	INTEGER ITKS(4):
		ITKS is a list of ALPHA track numbers corresponding to the
		decay products of the W pair.  Semi-leptonic channel:  ITKS(1)
		and ITKS(2) should be assigned the ALPHA jet track numbers
		resulting from the hadronic W.  ITKS(3) should be assigned
		the ALPHA track number for the lepton resulting from the
		leptonic W.  Hadronic channel:  ITKS(1) and ITKS(2) should be
		assigned the ALPHA jet track numbers resulting from the first
		hadronic W.  ITKS(3) and ITKS(4) should be assigned the ALPHA
		jet track numbers resulting from the second hadronic W.
		
		Default:  no default.

Output Arguments:

	INTEGER IFTKS(7):
		IFTKS is a list of ALPHA track numbers resulting from the
		chi-square fit.  The first four positions, IFTKS(1)...IFTKS(4),
		contain the track numbers for the "fitted" decay products of
		the W pair (in the same order as given in the ITKS array). 
		IFTKS(5) and IFTKS(6) contain the track numbers for W1 and W2
		respectively.  If ISR was varied in the fit, then IFTKS(7) 
		contains the track number for the ISR photon.  
		
		NOTE:  If IFTKS already contains _valid_ ALPHA track numbers, 
		then these track numbers are overwritten.  If the user wishes 
		to have _new_ ALPHA track numbers returned by the fitter, then
		IFTKS needs to be initialized to contains all zeros.
		
	REAL COV(13,13):
		A 13x13 covariance matrix resulting from the fit as returned by
		MINUIT's MIGRAD minimization routine.  The components of the
		matrix correspond to the order of the parameters as given in
		Appendix A.
		
	REAL CHISQ:
		This is the chi-square of the fit as determined by MIGRAD. 
					
	INTEGER ISTAT:
		ISTAT indicates the status of the fit.
			-2	Illegal input argument
			-1	Fit failed due to unphysical solution
			0	Covariance matrix not calculated at all
			1	Diagonal approximation to the covariance matrix
				only, not accurate
			2	Full covariance matrix, but forced 
				positive-definite
			3	Full accurate covariance matrix (normal
				convergence)

Appendix C:
	It is possible that only a certain combination of variable parameters 
	are desired for the fit.  The IOPT argument provides such an option.  
	Specifically, there is a one to one correspondence between each digit 
	in the binary representation of IOPT and each parameter.  The ordering 
	is such that the least signficant digit (in the binary representation 
	of IOPT) corresponds to parameter number 1, the next least significant 
	digit corresponds to parameter number 2 and so forth.  A digit equal 
	to 1 represents a variable parameter, while a 0 represents a fixed 
	parameter.
