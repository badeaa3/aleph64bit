@QJCONE IS A JET FINDING PACKAGE BASED ON A CONE ALGORITHM. 

WRITTEN BY WARRICK NEWTON OF SHEFFIELD UNIVERSITY.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION VIEW QJCONE.PS (ALSO AVAILABLE AS AN INTERNAL ALEPH NOTE
SUBMITTED IN JULY 1996:  ALEPH 96-094 anD PHYSIC 96-086).

RUNNING THE ALGORITHM REQUIRES A LINE OF THE FOLLOWING FORMAT:


        CALL QJCONE (NJETS,'name',ICLASS, R, ECUT, ITYPE, IMIN) 


WHERE THE ARGUMENTS ARE:

INPUT

ICLASS standard definition found in ALPHA user's guide
R      cone size or half-angle in radians.  RECOMMEND R=0.7 
ECUT   minimum energy of a jet in GeV.  RECOMMEND ECUT=7.0
TYPE   Type of cone to be used. ITYPE = 1, 2, 3 RECOMMEND TYPE=3
IMIN   minimum number of tracks in a jet. RECOMMEND IMIN=2

RETURNED

NJETS  number of jets found.
       GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO ZERO = number of jets found.
       LESS THAN ZERO 0 = too many jets found.  One-track jets removed.
                        Value is negative of number of jets found. 
       -100 = still too many jets found. Ten most energetic jets returned.
'name' vector containing the jet 4-momenta.
