C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C! Ensure no formats are written for POT banks.
C
C     Author: Stephen Haywood      28-Feb-91
C
C     Input  : MODE   = -1 to delete links to formats
C                     = +1 to restore links to formats
C
C     Called by MINOUT.
C
C     The banks whose formats will be dropped are listed on 'T' list,
C     which is prepared by MINOUT.
C
C     This requires changes to BOS system common.
C     The formats are disabled by zeroing their address. However, these
C     are restablished by garbage collections in the work space, and so
C     must be done just before the banks are written.

C
C++   Look at location of format for a reference bank to detect
C++   shifts of formats resulting from garbage collection.
C++   RUNH is chosen since it does not share its root with other banks.
C
      IOFF = IW(IDNAM-2) + MOD(IABS(INTCHA('RUNH')),NPRIM) - 3
      IOFF = IW(IDPTR+IOFF)

C++   Loop over banks to be written out.
C

         INAME = INTCHA(NAME)
C
C++      Try to pick up pointer to bank format.
C++      The pointers are associated with the name and several may
C++      share the same root, therefore allow a small number of loops.
C++      If correct, IOFF should correspond to 'pos' in BOSIO table.
C
         IOFF = IW(IDNAM-2) + MOD(IABS(INAME),NPRIM) - 3
         LOOP = 0

            IF (IOFF.LE.0) GOTO 100
            IF (IW(IDNAM+IOFF).NE.INAME) GOTO 90
C
C++      Pick up pointer.
C
         IF (MODE.EQ.-1) THEN
            KFMT = IW(IDFMT+IOFF)
         ELSE
            IF (KSAVE(I).LE.0) GOTO 100
            KFMT = KSAVE(I) + KSHFT
         ENDIF
C
C++      Check we really have found correct format bank.
C
         IF (IW(KFMT-3).NE.INTCHA('+FMT')) GOTO 100
         IF (IW(KFMT+1).NE.INAME) GOTO 100
C
C++      Modify pointer: either zero it or restore it.
C
         IF (MODE.EQ.-1) THEN
            KSAVE(I) = KFMT
            IW(IDFMT+IOFF) = 0
         ELSE
            IW(IDFMT+IOFF) = KFMT
