=================================================

 Correction file 125.12 released 19 Oct  2000
 Modifications w.r.t. ALPHA 125.10 :


 ** Add a new algorithm E14  provided by G. Taylor 
    to get the energy inside a cone of 14 degrees around the beam axis  

    Calling sequence:  CALL QGETE14(e14ec,e14hc,lveto)    
                       which returns the following values:

         e14ec = energy from Ecal/Lcal/Sical (in GeV) in 14 degree cone
         h14ec = energy from Hcal (in GeV) in 14 degree cone
         lveto = Maximum pulse height in LCAL veto counters

    This algorithm works only on POTs or DSTs, not on MINIs version 203
    and below. The E14 results will be available in the future from 
    MINIs version 204 and above, from a new bank (DE14) in which the
    3 above quantities will be stored during the MINI making. 

 ** Modifications to the MINI: new MINI, version 204

    - Build the DE14 bank (see above) for LEP2 MINIs only
    - Keep for LEP2 MINIs all the banks needed for redoing the Energy Flow
      from the MINI.
      
    A new executable miniprod_204 corresponding to the above modifications
    has been built on $ALEPH/phy for checking.
    The official miniprod is still the MINI 203 one.

 ** New data card MEFL 

    When reading future MINI 204 datasets, this new data card will allow
    to redo the Energy Flow from the MINI in the following way:

    - if this data card is put in the CARDs user file,
      the MINI ENergy Flow banks are not decoded, even if EFLW or EFLJ
      data cards are present;

    - the user can modify the conditions of the energy flow (locks, etc..) 
      then redo the energy flow explicitely with the usual calls: 
              CALL QUEFLO   !  execute the Energy Flow algorithm
              CALL QFEFLO   !  store the results in ALPHA variables
              CALL QFJETS   !  perform the Eflow jet-finding 

      The MEFL data card has no effect on older MINI datasets (version 203
      or before), or on POTs/DSTs.

=================================================

 Correction file 125.10 released 17 October 2000
 Modifications w.r.t. ALPHA 125.08 :

 - Fix in QFMCPA to write or read MINIs produced with any
   primary KINGAL generator + Kinagain using HERWIG
   (was possible only before with primary KINGAL = KRLW02)
  

=================================================

 Correction file 125.08 released 17 July 2000
 Modifications w.r.t. ALPHA 125.07 :

                                  
 ** Add a new function MINI_KPECPC provided by A. Venturi   
    to get the PCOB object number correctly on MINIs, which can't be
    obtained from the ALPHA statement function KPECPC

    Calling sequence:

          INTEGER FUNCTION MINI_KPECPC(IECAL)
  
 
      Input: IECAL (I) : ALPHA track number of the ECAL (PECO) object
 
      Output: (I): PCOB object number
 
      error code : -1 = invalid IECAL
                   -2 = IECAL is NOT a PECO object
                   -3 = cannot find PECO Julia number
                   -4 = cannot find PCRL         

=================================================

 Correction file 125.07 released 26 June 2000
 Modifications w.r.t. ALPHA 125.06 :

 ** Add dummy user routine QUREFIT called from QMEVNT before QFILL
    for tracking/alignment improvements
a55 141
=================================================

 Correction file 125.06 released 8 June 2000
 Modifications w.r.t. ALPHA 125.03 :

 ** New features for Year 2000 data with Mini-Ramps:

    All the new features described below work ONLY on Year 2000 data
    if the data card  MRMP has been provided by the user:
    (N.B. : this data card allows XLUMOK to give events taken during
            Mini-Ramps, otherwise these events are rejected).


    - in QWSUMM, the luminosity WITH MINIRAMP EVENTS is printed
      in addition to the standard one (which is without Miniramp events)
 
    - new routine to get the luminosity WITH MINIRAMP EVENTS 
      for the current run

        CALL QLMINRP(XLUMRMP,NBHAMRMP)

        returns XLUMRMP  = lumi for the current run WITH MINIRAMP EVENTS
                NBHAMRMP = corresponding number of Bhabhas

        If the routine is called for MC data, or real data of 1999 and before,
        or real data of Year 2000 without the use of the MRMP data card, 
        it returns XLUMRMP = -1. and NBHAMRMP = 0. 

 **  New logical function to know, for Year 2000 data, if an event was
     taken during a Mini-ramp or not:

     XMRMP(dummy)  = .true.  when event outside a miniramp ( Energy is stable)
                   = .false. when event taken during a miniramp

     The use of this function is independent of the data card MRMP.


=================================================

 Correction file 125.05 released 6 April 2000
 Modifications w.r.t. ALPHA 125.03 :

 ** Bug fixed in QDDX

 ** Mod in QJTHRU : 
    When one is using NOSC data card to remove SiCal from the Energy flow
    on MINIS, the value obtained for the thrust was wrong. This is because    
    on MINIS the thrust is read from a bank built from the standard thrust
    calculation, which is done when making the MINI and doesn't care about NOSC.

    Now if NOSC is present, and if one is reading a MINI, the thrust is
    recomputed and therefore consistent with the NOSC cleaning.

 ** New facility : automatic stageing in advance of all FILI cards (and only
    them) of an ALPHA job. This is done using a new data card :

 STGI

     All files given in the FILI CARDs are staged at the very beginning
     of the job. Some informations on this stageing are printed
     in the ALPHA standard output.

     --> mods in QMINIT, new routine QMSTGIN

 ** Modification of the stage_clear facility using the SCLR data card:

     now if one puts this data card

 SCLR

     all files staged during the ALPHA job are stage_cleared only if they
     were staged by the owner of the job, and read 1 or 2 times maximum.

     --> mods in QMSTCLR, new routine QANFILI

 The above facilities (STGI and SCLR) are completely independant.

 They are mostly intended for people who have to stage several files which
 are not frequently used (e.g. Monte-Carlo POTs !), and for which it is 
 important to free the corresponding space in the stage pool when the job
 is completed.


=================================================

 Correction file 125.03 released 7 March 2000
 Modifications w.r.t. ALPHA 125.02 :

 ** Bug fix in QGTHRU for Linux compilers
    - a test on the equality of two floating point numbers was
      never executed on Linux --> gave always thrust =0.  !

 ** New data card SCLR to allow the stage clear of the tapes 
    which have been used for the job:

SCLR

      This new facility is intended for jobs which access only once
      datasets which are not frequently used (e.g. MCarlo POTs)
      and which could flood the stageing area if not cleared.  

      The clearing is restricted to files which have been used
      once and only once, to avoid problems with other users.

      - mod in QMTERM, new routine QMSTCLR

 ** Modifications in the MINI code: bank DMSC which gives the multiple
    scattering angle of tracks between ITC and TPC, is filled now for
    all LEP II events and not only for CLAS24 events.

    - mod in routine MINBLD , new MINI version = 203 in mversn.h 
     
      Warning : the Mini executable is not changed yet
 
=================================================

 Correction file 125.02 released 1 February 2000
 Modifications w.r.t. ALPHA 125.01 :
                                  
 ** Use of new FJMMCL routine called by QGJMMC
    - with 'GENEVA' and 'INVMAS' algorithms
    - and possibility of asking for a given number of jets
      with YCUT <0 
      see ALEPHLIB ALNEWS or ALPHA user's guide for ALPHA125

 ** Small fix in QFNDV0

 ** New routines to write on output SEVT cards (intended for the
    "alignment event stripping project"):

      in QUEVNT for a selected event :  CALL QWRSEVT
      in QUTERM to write the resulting SEVT cards on file 'my_file'
                                        CALL QWRFSEVT(my_file)

 Correction file 124.13 released 25 August 1999
 Modifications w.r.t. ALPHA 124.12 :

 ** Small fix in QFPTPX ( wrong printout for 1999 data) 

 ** Modification in the QIPBTAG package to allow the use of QSMEAR
    (see below) : code provided by P-F Giraud and I. Tomalin 
    mods in QIPBTAG,BTAGINIT.BTAGPARNEW1,BTAGPARNEW2,FITDMIN,GTIPBK

 ** New user's routine QSMEAR, to be used after a call to QIPBTAG:

    QIPBTAG Track smearing & deletion :

      CALL QSMEAR(FIRST,QIPVER,SMBIN,RTBIN,
     >     NTRACK,NJET,FRF2TRK,PROBEVT,PROBHEMI,PROBJET,PROBTRK)

      QSMEAR is able to smear the three dimensional impact parameter
      significance and delete extra tracks in the Monte Carlo. It includes
      options for doing this work dependently on the polar angle and
      momentum of the tracks.

   Input Arguments :
        LOGICAL FIRST   = Is this the first call to QSMEAR since
                          calling QIPBTAG (or QIPBTAG2) ?
         CHAR*1 QIPVER  = '1' if being used after call to QIPBTAG.
                        = '2' if being used after call to QIPBTAG2.
         CHAR*1 SMBIN   = '0' no smearing correction at all.
                        = 'N' no binning in theta/p for smearing.
                        = 'T' binning in theta for smearing.
                        = 'P' binning in p for smearing.
                        = 'B' binning in both theta/p for smearing.
         CHAR*1 RTBIN   = '0' no track deletion at all.
                        = 'N' no binning in theta/p for deletion.
                        = 'T' binning in theta for deletion.
                        = 'P' binning in p for deletion.
                        = 'B' binning in both theta/p for deletion.
           Plus same arguments of call to QIPBTAG.

   Output Arguments: 
           Same arguments overwritten with smeared values
           The -ve tag quantities in /BTAGRAW/ are also smeared.

      It is possible to smear Monte Carlo from a different year than the
      data by including the keyword QPYR in the alpha card file with an 
      argument YYMM:

      eg : QPYR 9701

      It is also possible to use private smearing/deletion cards : beware
      the bank number should then be -1. (See the package SMEARFIT on UPHY)

  >>> IMPORTANT modifications to QIPBTAG <<< 

  *******     Please read details below  *******


  1 - New analysis tool in ALPHA : QDDX  - New code from Tommaso BOCCALI
      ==================================================================

      Combined estimation for dE/dx, using TPC Wires and Pads
      informations.

      The final calibration of the pad dE/dx is still underway,
      but the change in the performance is expected not to be dramatic.
  
      Calling sequence :  

      call  qddx(itk, nhyp, rmass, Q, ns,npad,extimator, ier)

      INPUT arguments :
        itk         : ALPHA TRACK
        nhyp        : Number of hypotheses to be tested
        rmass       : vector(1..nhyp) of the masses of the tests
        Q           : vector(1..nhyp) of the charge of the tests
                     
      rmass and Q must be correctly dimensioned in the calling routine

      OUTPUT arguments :
        ns          : number of wires available, -1 if no wires info
        npad        : number of pads (REAL!!!!), -1 if no pad info
        extimator   : (ri-rexp)/sigma for each test particle
        ier         : 1 if no information was available
                    : 0 if an estimator was calculated
                
           rmass, Q and extimator must be correctly dimensioned
           in the calling routine.


      For questions concerning the code or the results of the routine, 
      please send an e-mail to :
             Tommaso.Boccali@@cern.ch or Duccio.Abbaneo@@cern.ch    


 2 - New tool in ALPHA : QBMTAG - Code from Ian TOMALIN, was in UPHY
     ===============================================================

     2.1 Warning to the users :
         --------------------

       The routine QBMTAG, which can be used in conjunction with QIPBTAG
       to provide extremely pure (99%) b hemisphere tagging, is now        
       available in ALPHA124. It was available since a long time on UPHY.

       The ALPHA124 version of QBMTAG gives identical performance to the
       UPHY one. 
       However, in addition to providing  a btag for each event 
       hemisphere, it now also does so for each jet in the event.

 ===>  The calling arguments of QBMTAG have been CHANGED to output
 ===>  this extra information, so you will need to change your call 
 ===>  if you used the UPHY version.


     2.2 Description :
         -----------
     Invariant mass b tag.

     Can be called after QIPBTAG or QVSRCH, to further increase b purity.

     For each event-half QBMTAG loops over tracks in order of decreasing
     inconsistency with primary vertex, and stops when their combined
     invariant mass exceeds 1.8 GeV. (i.e. The mass of a typical charmed
     hadron). It then returns a tag, CLMASS, indicating the probablity 
     that the "last track" used came from primary vertex.
     For a very high purity tag, CLMASS should be combined with the
     QIPTBAG or QVSRCH tags. The optimal linear combination (together 
     with suggested cuts) is
          0.7*CLMASS - 0.3*log10(QIPBTAG) > 2.4
     or   0.7*CLMASS + 0.3*QVSRCH > 8.3
  
     2.3 Calling sequence : 
         ----------------

      CALL QBMTAG (METHOD,NTRACK,NJET,TRKJET,PROBTRK,FRF2TRK,
     +             PVTX,SVTX,DJET,
     +             CLMASS,CTSTAR,NSEC,CLMASJ,CTSTAJ,NSECJ,
     +             LISTTRK,LISTEH,LISTJET)
  
      2.3.1. Input Arguments:

        INTE METHOD    : =1 if using QIPBTAG, =2 if using QVSRCH.
      Following only needed if METHOD=1 (dummy otherwise):
        INTE NTRACK    : Number of tracks used by QIPBTAG.
        INTE NJET      : Number of jets considered by QIPBTAG.
        INTE TRKJET(*) : ALPHA track number of QIPBTAG jets.
        REAL PROBTRK(*): QIPBTAG track probabilities.
        INTE FRF2TRK(*): Row in FRFT bank of QIPBTAG tracks.
      Following only needed if METHOD=2 (dummy otherwise):
        REAL PVTX(3)   : Position of primary vertex from QVSRCH.
        REAL SVTX(3,2) : Positions of two secondary vertices in jet
                         coordinate system from QVSRCH.
        REAL DJET(3,2) : Unitized jet directions from QVSRCH.
        
      2.3.2 Output Arguments: 
            (Dimensioned 2 to correspond to two event-halves):

        REAL CLMASS(2) : For METHOD=1, = -log10(confidence level) for
                     "last track" to come from primary vertex
                     (c.l. in range 0-1).
                     For METHOD=2, = QSQT(CHI**2 (primary) minus
                     CHI**2 (secondary)) for "last track".
        REAL CTSTAR(2) : Decay angle of "last track" in "b" rest frame.
        INTE NSEC(2)   : Number of tracks used to reach 1.8 GeV mass.
                     (zero if couldn't reach 1.8 GeV).

      Following jet info available only if METHOD=1:
        REAL CLMASJ(*) : Same variables for jets (ordered as in TRKJET)
        REAL CLSTAJ(*) :            "
        INTE NSECJ(*)  :            "

        INTE LISTTRK(*): List of all ALPHA charged tracks and V0s which
                     were considered by QBMTAG.
                     If the track is neutral, it is a V0. If a V0
                     is not in the range KFV0T-KLV0T, then it has
                     been created using YTOP, and its daughters
                     are (refitted) copies of tracks from the
                     KFCHT-KLCHT section.
        INTE LISTEH(*) : If track comtributed to 1.8 GeV hemisphere mass 
                     then =1 or =2 to show which hemisphere it's in.
                     If =0, then track was rejected.
        INTE LISTJET(*): If track comtributed to 1.8 GeV jet mass,
                     then =ALPHA track number of jet.
                     If =0, then track was rejected.

      2.4  Remarks :  
           ---------

      IF METHOD=1, then one can obtain higher purities by using the
      BNEG card. This allows QIPBTAG and QBMTAG to use information from
      both +ve and -ve impact parameter tracks. (See ALNEWS 1389 in
      OFFLINE folder). If one omits this card, however, then in the same
      way as one can measure the uds efficiency of QIPBTAG using the -ve
      hemisphere tag NPROBHEMI, it is possible to create a -ve tag from
      QBMTAG for the same purpose. This can be done by calling it with
      argument NPROBTRK instead of PROBTRK.
 

      Please send all remarks concerning this package to : 
      Ian.Tomalin@@cern.ch

 
 3 - Bug fix in TRSEL (in the QIPBTAG package) : thanks to David Smith
     ===========================================                   

     This bug affected the definition of the d0,z0 cuts made in the 
     track selection routine TRSEL. Was not present in ALPHA122.
     Seems to have no effect when using standard QIPBTAG set-up 
     (to be confirmed).
    
     This fix is independent of the modifications to QIPBTAG described
     below.


 4 - Modifications in the QIPBTAG package, from Ian TOMALIN :
     ========================================================           

     QIPBTAG has been modified at the request the heavy flavour group.
 
     4.1 Does this affect you ?
         ----------------------

 These mods. will not affect you unless:

     1) You are running QIPBTAG on LEP1 data and have an NQIP card,
 or  2) You are running QIPBTAG on reprocessed LEP1 data,
 or  3) You have private versions of some QIPBTAG routines.
  
 If one of these three cases applies to you, then to continue obtaining 
 the same results as before you must:

 For case (1):
   The new code is not backwards compatible. Therefore, continue using
   ALPHA123 and adbs246.daf. Also please contact Ian Tomalin.

 For case (2):
   Include an OQIP card in your card file (which you can already do now).

 For case (3):
   You can continue using ALPHA123. Alternatively, before changing to
   ALPHA124, you will need to update any private versions you may have
   of the following routines :
     btagfit.F, btagpar.F, btagpar96.F, codsel.F, fitdmin.F, gtipbk.F,
     qipbtag.F 
   Note also that the QIPBTAG include file btpar.h has changed,
     so you must recompile any code using this.


     4.2 Full list of changes made to QIPBTAG :
         ------------------------------------

      4.2.1 Information :

     (i) Throughout this NEWS, "LEP1" refers to data taken with the
         old VDET and "LEP2" to data taken with the new VDET.

    (ii) This NEWS refers often to the "VDET96" option, which was made
         available inside QIPBTAG a few years ago. In ALPHA123, this
         option was already used by default at LEP2, and could be
         obtained at LEP1 with the NQIP card (see ALPHA manual).

         Compared with the original version of QIPBTAG, the "VDET96"
         option introduced the following changes:
         - (a) Tracks are classified not only according to the number
               of hits they have in the VDET, but also according to
               the number of hits they were expected to have.
         - (b) The cuts used for selecting the tracks used
               by QIPBTAG were retuned.
         - (c) The BNEG option (see ALPHA manual) 
               was switched on by default.
   
      4.2.2 Changes in ALPHA124:
            --------------------

1) By default, the "VDET96" option will be switched on if you run on
   LEP1 data/MC reprocessed with the tracking upgrade JULIA. It will
   still be off by default on old LEP1 data.

2) The defaults can be overridden with cards:
           NQIP    - Switch VDET96 option on
           OQIP    - Switch VDET96 option off
           BNEG    - force BNEG option on
           NOBG    - force BNEG option off (even if VDET96 option is on).

3) The modified QIPBTAG track selection cuts used by the VDET96 option
   in ALPHA123 were tuned on LEP2 data. They do not work well at LEP1.
   Therefore, in ALPHA124, if you are running on LEP1 data, the VDET96
   option will use the original (Dave Brown) track selection cuts.

4) The QIPC database bank which parametrizes the impact parameter 
   resolution at LEP1, has been recalibrated for the new LEP1 VDET96
    option.

5) One cosmetic change: When doing calibrations, the calibration
   histograms were numbered 151-157 which put them in the middle 
   of the user's own histograms. 
   In ALPHA124, they have therefore been offset by 100000.
   Furthermore, this offset can be changed with the CALB card.
 
6) At the beginning of your ALPHA job, QIPBTAG now prints out slightly
   more information explaining which options it is using.

7) The VDET96 option was introduced a few years ago by duplicating
   a few QIPBTAG subroutines. This was unnecessary and makes the 
   QIPBTAG code difficult to maintain. Therefore in ALPHA124:

    a) fitdmin.F and fitdmin96.F have been merged back into a single
       routine.

    b) 75% of btagpar.F and btagpar96.F were in common. Therefore 
       their common code has been extracted an put into a single
       routine btaginit.F
    
     4.3 Performance :
         -------------

 On reprocessed 1994 MC, the performance of QIPBTAG in ALPHA124 
 and ALPHA123 has been compared compared for two sets of cuts:

         a) TIGHT cuts: QIPBTAG(hemi) < 1.0e-4 for events with
                        cos(theta_thrust) < 0.7

         b) LOOSE cuts: QIPBTAG(hemi) < 1.0e-2 for events with
                        cos(theta_thrust) < 0.8

 Hemisphere b, c, and uds efficiencies obtained are as follows:

                           TIGHT cuts
                           ===========

                                epsilon_b    epsilon_c    epsilon_uds
  ALPHA124                        30.0%        1.17%         0.05%
  ALPHA123 (BNEG card)            29.9%        1.10%         0.05%
  ALPHA123 (NQIP card)            30.1%        1.17%         0.08%

                            LOOSE cuts
                            ==========

                                epsilon_b    epsilon_c    epsilon_uds
  ALPHA124                        55.9%        10.2%         0.92%
  ALPHA123 (BNEG card)            55.6%        10.1%         0.95%
  ALPHA123 (NQIP card)            55.8%        10.2%         1.29%

 Please note the following:

 i) The NQIP card used with ALPHA123 switches on the VDET96 option.
    This gives rather poor performance at LEP1 because the 
    QIPBTAG VDET96 track selection cuts were tuned at LEP2.
    (See (3) in 4.2.2 above).

 ii) As ALPHA124 and ALPHA123 (NQIP) both switch on the BNEG option 
     by default, the comparison with the old "Dave Brown" QIPBTAG 
     in ALPHA123 was done using the BNEG card.

 iii) ALPHA124 and ALPHA123 (BNEG) give almost identical performances.

 iv)  The cuts used for these tests were not exactly equal to those 
      quoted above, but were varied slightly so that all 
      QIPBTAG versions gave roughly the same b tagging efficiency.


            Please send any remark on this new QIPBTAG code to :

  Modifications w.r.t ALPHA 123.06
  
  ** Fix in QMCARD to set up automatically the NSEQ data card

  ** New feature : subroutine QFPTPX , from F. Palla , called in QFILL
     (and subroutines called inside it : QGTPDDX,QDOTPXS,QWRTPXS)

     !!  Warnings !! ===> Works only on POTS, not on DSTs !
                     ===> Needs unpacking and sorting of TPC coordinates,
                          i.e. data card  UNPK  'AL SO'
                          Doesn't work with default UNPK data card !!
  
     Purpose: 
     Recreates the pad dE/dx bank PTPX with the good calibration
     in the following cases :
 
     LEP1 : 
     ====
     The routine QFPTPX is called when doing the MINIs from POTs for :

     - all MCarlos produced from December 1998 onwards with Julia >= 308.6
     - all reprocessed DATA using  Julia versions >=300.0 AND <=308.3

     When reading a POT the default is to call the subroutine. 
     The user is allowed to use the full information when reading
     MCarlo datasets  produced with Julia >=308.6  
     but is  warned that the calibration might be different.

     If the user would like not to apply the correction to the Data
     (in that case, just put the card NOPX in the data cards)
     he/she is warned that the Pad dE/dx is WRONG.
  
     LEP2 :
     ====

     For 1998 reprocessed data (Julia >=308.4) the routine acts as do-nothing.
     
     For all other years for which the reprocessing of the data has not yet been
     done (1995 LEP2->1997 i.e. Julia<=308.3) QFPTPX is called when reading POTs
     both for Data or MC even if this has been produced using Julia => 308.4.
     In case the Data will be reprocessed in the future then the call to the
     subroutine will not be the default.

  ** Modif in QMININC to set up correctly the UNPK data card for MINI
     official productions when QFPTPX has to be called.

  Correction file 123.04 released 28 October 1998
  Modifications w.r.t ALPHA 122.48
 

 1 - Various changes,fixes or protections :
     ====================================

    **  Protections added in TRSEL,QIPBTAG,QXTRAP (QIPBTAG package)

    **  QDATA : change default of KDEBUG KDEBU1 KDEBU2  from 1 1 999999
                                                        to 0 1 3

    **  QMCARD : protect DEBU card against less than 3 words
              with a DEBU 0 card KDEBU1 and KDEBU2 keep the default
              values set in QDATA

    **  MDIPBT : protect print statement with DEBU card KDEBU1,2
                 limits, or NERROR < 10.  

    **  QFILL : The filling of the GAT section (Photons from GAMPEK  
                bank PGAC) is now done BEFORE calling the energy flow
                to allow for photon energy rescaling by calling 
                the modified version of GAMPEK released on 28.10.98
                To perform this photon rescaling, one has to put
                in the CARDs file the two data cards below:
                
                DRGA  !  to drop the existing PGAC bank
                REPG  !  to call GAMPEK and fill the new PGAC

    **  QFILL,QTRESC : to get the momentum correction using QPCORR
                       ("sagitta correction" for charged tracks)
                       working properly according to the data card PCOR:
        PCOR 0  if the analysis doesn't require specifically VDET
                coordinates
        PCOR 1  if the analysis ONLY uses tracks with VDET coordinates 

    **  KGTBLQ : put IAND instead of AND to compile on HP machines

    **  QWSUMM : change luminosity format (was not OK since we have more
                 than 100 pb**-1 in the same year in 1998 !)
  
    **  XSAME statement function : works now for all 448 possible bits
              and not only for the 320 first ones (bug present since 
              July 1993...)


     2 - MINI initialisation for official productions:
     ================================================

     Modifications in QMCARD, and new routine QMININC to make a standard
     initialisation of the MINI running conditions for official productions.

     - triggered by a new data card   MINP
      
     - the only cards needed now in addition of MINP are 
       FILI,FILO,NSEQ (and possibly SRUN/IRUN or SEVT cards)

     - all necessary data cards for ENFLW, jets, QFNDIP, QIPBTAG etc..
       are generated automatically

     - the data cards for QSELEP are generated with the official 
       cuts to make the MINI properly. If MINP is present, any
       user-supplied data card for QSELEP will be IGNORED.

     Nothing is changed for private MINI productions.


 3 - LEP energy and ALPHA variable QELEP :
     ===================================
  
     A - Motivation :
         ----------

  The previous situation in ALPHA was very unsatisfactory. For historical
  reasons, the QELEP variable giving the LEP energy was defined only once 
  per LEP fill as the average energy for all good runs of the fill and 
  taken from a database bank.

  The "instantaneous" energy made available by the LEP experts (for time 
  slices of 15 minutes) for 1996 and 1997 LEP 2 runs, and the precise 
  run-averaged LEP energies for LEP1 runs were available from the 
  user-callable routines QELEP2 and QELEP1, the existence of which
  was ignored by a majority of users.

  The modifications done in the new version put in QELEP the best possible  
  available value of the energy, on an event-by-event basis and not as an
  average over a LEP fill. There is no more need to call privately QELEP1
  or QELEP2.

     B - Modifications :
         -------------

  QMNEWR : no more call to GETLEP, no more filling of QELEP (done now  
           in QFGET_BP for each event).

  QFGET_BP : calls the ALEPHLIB routine GETLEP which returns QELEP

     C - User subroutine to know how QELEP was found :
         -------------------------------------------

         CALL QWHICH_EN(ISTAT)

         Ouput argument :  ISTAT

   ISTAT = 0  no energy found (should never happen !)
         = 1  from the 'RLEP' bank (always the case for MCarlo)
         = 2  from the 'LFIL' bank
              for 1989 -> 1992 real data
              or LEP2 data when neither time-slice nor run-averaged
         = 3  from the run-averaged values of the LEP Working Group
              for 1993 -> 1995 LEP 1 data, 
              or for LEP 2 data if no time-slice available
         = 4  from the 15' time-slices of the LEP Working Group
              for LEP 2 data

  
 4 - Beam spot position and d0,z0 of charged tracks :
     ============================================== 

     A - Motivation :
         ----------

  Here the previous situation gave rise to contradictions.   
  Such a contradiction occured in the 1998 MINI-making where the beam spot
  definition was not the same at the time of the MINI-making and at the time
  of reading the resulting MINIs.

  The event-chunk beam position (see ALPHA user's guide p 31) was used to
  compute the event interaction point (QFNDIP package) or the secondary
  vertices or b tags in the QIPBTAG package. As a result, the ALPHA
  variables for d0,z0  of charged tracks didn't match with the ones
  used inside these packages.
  
  The modifications introduced in ALPHA 123 have the following effect:

  The event-chunk beam position is always used as beam spot whenever it exists.
  The d0,z0 variables in ALPHA are computed with respect to it and are
  therefore consistent everywhere.
 
  Differences between the new, correct values and the old ones are usually
  very small but may result in differences when applying cuts on d0,z0.
 
  Users - especially LEP 2 data users - are warned that this modfication is 
  NOT backward compatible, but that the new values are the good ones, to be 
  used both for real data and for Monte Carlo data.


     B - Modifications :
         -------------

  QMDBAS : the reading of the old LEP1 beam positions for 1991-1994 from
           file BEAMPOSITION is removed from QMDBAS; it is done now in
           the ALEPHLIB routine getbp

  QMNEWR : does not fill QVXNOM,QVYNOM,QVZNOM any more


  QFILL  : calls QFILBP twice, the first time to compute the beam spot
           the second time after the Energy Flow to call QFNDIP

  QFILBP : modified to be called twice, as explained above

  QFGET_BP : calls now the ALEPHLIB routine GETLEP, which in turn
             calls the event-chunk routine GETBP, previously
             QVXNOM,QVYNOM,QVZNOM filled here now
             If the event-chunk beam position exists:
             the arrays QVTXBP,QVTEBP,QVTSBP are filled here
  QBEAMX : reads the beam.position file for LEP1 MCarlo datasets, if needed,
           to get the banks WIDN and WIDE.

  FIXALPB and XFMCBP : removed from ALPHA , put in the ALEPHLIB

  Remarks : 1 / Nothing is changed for the use of the LEP BOMS
  =======       obtained when using the data card BOBS
                (see the description in this NEWS file below,
                in the modifications done for the correction file
                ALPHA 122.41). 

            2 / QFD0Z0 : modified to be called only if the data card 'D0NW'
                is present and if one asks for the QFNDIP package.
        ===>    Be careful: the errors quoted on d0,z0 are not correct.
        ===>    Will be updated and fixed later.
        ===>    Should not be used for the time being.


     C - User subroutine to know how the beam spot was found :
         ---------------------------------------------------

         CALL QWHICH_BP(ISTAT)

         Ouput argument :  ISTAT
  
  ISTAT  = 0  no beam position found (should never happen)
         = 1  from the 'JSUM' bank - should be very rare,
              only if getbp fails and neither RXYZ nor LFIL exist
         = 2  from the 'LFIL' bank, if getbp fails and no RXYZ exists
         = 3  from the 'RXYZ' bank (only for old LEP1 data processing
              of 1989 -> 1995 if getbp fails )
         = 4  from getbp (event-chunk beam position)
  
  Remark : If the LEP BOMs were used, the corresponding status is obtained 
           with the subroutine QFILBP_STATUS(KFILBP), see ALPHA 122.41

                        Last Update: 17 July  1998
========================================================================
 
  ALPHA version 122 

  All features of the successive correction files are summarized below ,
  starting from the most recent one. The oldest one corresponds to ALPHA 122.30
  All older corrections or new features are described in the ALPHA User's Guide 
  released on June 6th, 1997.

===================================================

  Correction file 122.48 released 17 July 1998
  Modifications w.r.t ALPHA 122.47

  ** Modifications in QFILL, from F. Ligabue
     in order to make easier the work of the LEP 2 W group.
     All these modifications act as do-nothing by default.

     - Call a new user routine QURESC (dummy) 
       the user may call it to make several rescalings of HCAL and ECAL 
       for systematic studies
       see explanations in the comments of the routine:
       /al/reference/cvs/alpha122/pack/quresc.F
     - If a data card PCOR is provided, a new routine QTRESC is called
       by QFILL to rescale all charged track momenta (so-called "sagitta
       correction"). QTRESC calls automatically for all tracks the routine
       QPCORR (see news for ALPHA 122.44 of March 2nd, 1998)
       which does the sagitta correction track by track.

===================================================

  Correction file 122.47 released 4 June 1998
  Modifications w.r.t ALPHA 122.46

  ** Modifications in the Beam position routines, from S. Wasserbach:

     - Mod in qfget_bp to handle the glitch in the ALPB bank for MINI LEP1
       reprocessing and MINI 1997 made with MINI versions 103 and 104
       (a very small fraction of events have the uncertainty on y_beam =0.,
        the correction sets this uncertainty to the average value for the
        corresponding year).

     - Mod in qfilbp: default values of QVTXBP,QVTEBP,QVTSBP are set to
       crazy values (position = 999. cm, uncertainty and luminous region =0.) 
       to force people to make a test on XGETBP=.TRUE.

  ** The 10 routines XLUMOK,..XVDEOK removed from the cvs source code are now 
     really removed from the ALPHA binary libraries (see news for ALPHA 122.42
     of January 20th,1998): they were still on the libraries and used intead of
     the ALEPHLIB ones, by mistake.

  Correction file 122.45 released 02 Mar 1998
  Modifications w.r.t ALPHA 122.44

  ** New Function QPCORR  (from Ian Tomalin).
       
     Purpose :

     Corrects particle momenta for the effects of residual distortions in
     the central tracking detector.
     This is the so called "sagitta correction".
     It depends upon cos(theta) and the year of data taking.
  
     Motivation:

     Every year, even after the detector alignment is finished and
     corrections have been made for field distortions etc., it is found
     that Ebeam/P in Z0 -> mu+mu- events is not precisely 1, presumably
     because of residual distortions.
     (Typically, in the region |cos(theta)| > 0.9, Ebeam/p is about 0.94
     for +ve tracks and 1.06 for -ve tracks. Elsewhere, Ebeam/p is usually
     consistent with 1 to within a percent or so. The effect is not quite
     forward-backward symmetric).

     The relative bias in momentum is proportional to P, so most people
     analysing hadronic events can ignore it. Exceptions include analyses
     using the ECAL electron identifiers in the region |cos(theta)| > 0.9,
     or analyses which are very sensitive to systematic biases in the
     momenta (e.g. jet charge, tau polarization).

     This routine provides a correction for the momenta based upon
     Ebeam/P measurements in Z0 -> mu+mu- events. It assumes that the
     corrections for -ve and +ve particles are equal in size, but of
     opposite sign. This is observed to be true, apart from a constant
     offset, Ebeam/p = 1.002, which is also present in the MC and so not
     corrected for.
     
     In principle, the correction depends upon your track selection
     cuts, but providing that the corrections have a small effect on your
     analysis, you can ignore this. Arguement NVDET does correct for this
     to first approximation however.

     Calling the routine: 

      FUNCTION QPCORR(ITRK,ASCALE,NVDET,ERCORR)

     Input Arguments:
       ITRK    (Integer): ALPHA track number.
       ASCALE  (Logical): Set .TRUE. if ALPHA variables like QX,QY,QZ
                          are to be rescaled by calling QVSCAL.
                          N.B. Don't call this routine twice for the
                          same track with ASCALE = .TRUE. !
       NVDET   (Integer): If your analysis only uses tracks with at
                          least 1 VDET hit, set NVDET=1; otherwise =0.
     Output Arguments:
       QPCORR  (Real)   : Scale factor applied/to be applied to momentum.
       ERCORR  (Real)   : Statistical error on this factor.
 
     If corrections are not available for any year, please contact the 
     tracking group.
   

  ** New data cards FR12 and FR10 for the Monte Carlo smearing of charged
     tracks introduced in JULIA 306:
 
     Purpose:
    
     JULIA 306 implements the TPC hit smearing for MonteCarlo. FRFT/0 (without
     VDET) and FRFT/2 (with VDET) contain the track parameters after refit
     with the smeared hits but keeping the error matrix from the unsmeared fit.
     This gives the best agreement between data and MonteCarlo.
     The track fit using the unsmeared TPC hits is still available in 
     FRFT/10 (no VDET hits in the fit), and FRFT/12 (with VDET).
     Note that the V0s, kinks etc. are done with the  smeared tracks.
    
     Therefore when reading in ALPHA a dataset written by JULIA >= 306, the
     charged tracks obtained by default are as usual the FRFT/2 ones, i.e. 
     the smeared ones with VDET hits in the track fit.   

     The new data cards allow to get in the ALPHA variables the unsmeared tracks
     for checks or comparisons, allowing to redo e.g. the V0 finding using the
     data card REV0, or the pair finding calling the routine QPAIRF. 

     Usage:

     FR12   puts in the ALPHA variables the FRFT/12 tracks : unsmeared, with
            VDET hits in the track fit;

     FR10   puts in the ALPHA variables the FRFT/10 tracks : unsmeared, without
            VDET hits in the track fit.
     

     N.B.1: the old FRF0 data card still works and puts in the ALPHA variables
            the FRFT/10 tracks : SMEARED without VDET hits in the track fit.
               
     N.B.2: one cannot give simultaneously 2 of the 3 data above data cards 
            (FR10,FR12,FRF0): if this is the case, ALPHA stops immediately.

===================================================

  Correction file 122.44 released 10 Feb 1998
  Modifications w.r.t ALPHA 122.42

  ** Increase BOS array to 1,500,000 by default (for LEP2 MCarlos) in QUIBOS

  ** Mod in QFILL, new routines QD0Z0 and KD0FL for new d0,z0 calculation:
     with use of a new data card D0NW as follows :

  1 - by default, one gets the same d0,z0 as in previous versions of ALPHA in
      the variables QDB(ITK) and QZB(ITK). This ensures backward-compatibility,
      but should not be taken as good for LEP2 runs and future LEP1 reprocessing

  2 - if the user puts a new data card:  D0NW       in the  CARDS file,
      QDB(ITK) and QZB(ITK) give new values of d0,z0 obtained as follows:

   ==> if there is no QFND data card, the "beam position" which is used
       is the event-chunk one, if it exists;

   ==> if there is a QFND card, the "beam position" which is used is the event
       main vertex computed by QFNDIP, if it exists.

   This new feature is valid both for LEP1 and LEP2 runs.
     
     In all cases, a new integer function tells which kind of beam position
     was used for a given event to compute d0,z0:

   IFLAG = KD0FL(dummy)

   The return value IFLAG has the following meaning:

   IFLAG = 1 if beam position from the QFNDIP event primary vertex
   IFLAG = 2 if beam position is the event-chunk one
   IFLAG = 3 if beam position from the old LEP 1 run-by-run average
               (= QVXNOM,QVYNOM,QVZNOM)
   IFLAG = 0 if none of the above values available
             in that case the beam position is set to 0.,0.,0. 

===================================================

  Correction file 122.42 released 20 Jan 1998
  Modifications w.r.t ALPHA 122.41

 ** Removal of XLUMOK and XVDEOK from the ALPHA code, since these functions are
    now in the ALEPHLIB. The calls to these routines are of course left in 
    ALPHA and this removal is user-transparent.

    All routines called by XLUMOK and now in the ALEPHLIB are also removed
    from ALPHA: LLUMOK,SLUMOK,XLSLUM,XT0SYN,XPTENB,QRE133,QRE94

    All routines called by XVDEOK and now in the ALEPHLIB are also removed
    from ALPHA: QHVSTA,KVGOOD

 ** Modification in QIPBTAG for LEP2 data and MCarlo: (from M. Thulasidas)
    Mod in BTAG_PAR96, new routine GTIPBK.
    The calibration constants for QIPBTAG are now read from the ADBSCONS
    database bank 'QIPC'. 
    The user MUST remove any old FITP cards from his CARDs file for LEP2 data
    and MCarlo, otherwise ALPHA stops. The use of FITP cards remains possible
    for LEP1 data/MCarlo.

===================================================

  Correction file 122.41 released 27 Nov 1997
  Modifications w.r.t ALPHA 122.40
  
 
 ** New facility: calculation of the beam spot informations using the LEP BOMs
                  for 1996 and 1997 data. 

    Code written by O. Schneider and maintained by C.Loomis.

    The ALPHA routine QFILBP has been modified to call a new routine, KGTBLQ.
    It allows to use the LEP BOMs+QS0 informations to compute the beam spot 
    information, stored in the ALPHA arrays QVTXBP, QVTEBP and QVTSBP
    which are used by QFNDIP and QIPBTAG.

    By default, nothing is changed w.r.t to the previous ALPHA version. 

    The user does'nt need to call any routine. To activate the new facility,
    one has to provide a data card BOBS with the following syntax:

 BOBS sigmax sigmay bom_only debug 

     sigmax   = real number equal to the LEP_BOM+QS0 intrinsic resolution in x; 
     sigmay   = real number equal to the LEP_BOM+QS0 intrinsic resolution in y; 
     bom_only = integer flag to indicate whether one wants to use only
                LEP_BOM+QS0information (bom_only=1)
                or if one wants to use the weighted average between the
                LEP_BOM+QS0 information and the VDET chunk-by-chunk information
                (bom_only=0); 
     debug    = integer flag to switch debug printout ON (debug=1) or OFF
                (debug=0). 

     If any of the above values are missing on the BOBS card, the following 
     default values are used:

     sigmax   = 0.0040 (i.e., 40 microns); 
     sigmay   = 0.0010 (i.e., 10 microns); 
     bom_only = 0 (i.e., use weighted average); 
     debug    = 0 (i.e., no debug printout). 

  ==>  Notes: 

        1 - if sigmax (or sigmay) is given a negative value on the BOBS card,
            then the LEP_BOM+QS0 information is not used for the x (or y)
            coordinate of the beam spot position. 

        2 - This new facility needs a bank, BLQP, which is not available for
            datasets produced with JULIA versions before 284. For these data
            sets, the BOBS card acts as do-nothing.

        3 - When using this new facility, to know the status of the ALPHA beam
            spot position one may call :

                       CALL QFILBP_STATUS(KFILBP) 

     KFILBP is an integer output argument with the following meaning: 

     KFILBP = 0 means that XGETBP=.FALSE.,
                           i.e. chunk-by-chunk VDET beam position not available
                           ---> QVTXBP(I)=QVTEBP(I)=QVTSBP(I)=0 for I=1,3
 
     KFILBP > 0 means that XGETBP=.TRUE.,
                           i.e. chunk-by-chunk VDET beam position     available
                           ---> QVTXBP(I) and QVTEBP(I), I=1,2 are filled with
                                VDET data or BOM+QS0 data or a weighted average
                                of both according to the table below

               KFILBP   I=1 (x)   I=2 (y)
               ------   -------   -------
                 0      -         -
                 1      VDET      VDET
                 2      BOM+QS0   VDET
                 3      VDET      BOM+QS0
                 4      BOM+QS0   BOM+QS0
                 5      Average   VDET
                 6      VDET      Average
                 7      Average   Average

====================================================

  Correction file 122.36 released 21 Oct 1997
  Modifications w.r.t correction file ALPHA 122.35

 ** New feature in the QFNDIP package, introduced by  N. Konstantinidis for   
    LEP 2 events:
   
   A new data card DWIN allows to control the use of the longitudinal
   component of tracks. 

   Syntax and usage of the data card:

 DWIN USE_LONG WINDOW
 
   If USE_LONG=1, use tracks with: Distance(track-jet) < WINDOW
   If USE_LONG=2, use tracks with: ABS(Distance(track-jet)) < WINDOW
 
   If DWIN is absent or USE_LONG=1 and WINDOW=0.0, the user gets 
   the standard QFNDIP results.
   
   Recommended values for LEP2:

   DWIN  1  0.035
 

 ** New fix in QFYLV0 (Routine which stores the so-called "Long V0s" from
    datasets processed with the new tracking, JULIA version > 300) :
    A bug in the mother-daughter relations was introduced 
    by the previous fix of version 122.35. Thanks to H. Seywerd, who found the 
    bug and checked the corrected version.

====================================================

    coming from the new tracking were not set correctly

  - Small fix in QNVSTO (internal routine to store new vertices from the
                         new tracking)
  
  - New user printout routine QWNEWTR to get details of the new vertices
    ("Long V0s", Kinks, Nuclear Interactions) from the new tracking.
    This routine is called automatically by QWEVNT but may be called 
    independently for a given event by the user :   CALL QWNEWTR

  ** - Modification in QFMCPA to avoid  crashes in some ALPHA statement
       functions, due to very low energy photons with Px=Py=0. generated by   
       some 1997 Monte-Carlos.

  ** - New version of GETLUM put provisionnally in ALPHA (to be put in the
       ALEPHLIB in the future) to get the run luminosity from the LUMI bank
       if the luminosity in the RLUM bank is 0.

  ** - New routine QELEP1 to get the exact LEP energy for all EW/EA runs  
       of 1993,1994 and for the runs at the Z0 taken in 1995. 
       
       For more details, see the ALEPH note from Paul Bright-Thomas:
 
       "LEP Energies for 1993-1995", ALEPH 97/082, PHYSIC 97/072
       (11 August 1997).
  
 
      This routine has to be called by the user once per run:   

              CALL QELEP1(ENERGY,IFLAG)

       It gives 2 output arguments:

 
     IFLAG = 2     ENERGY (in GeV) is the exact energy of the current run. 
                 
     IFLAG = 3     ENERGY = QELEP (in GeV) for all other cases: runs which are
                   not good for the EW/EA groups, MCarlo runs, runs of 1989-92.

  The information for IFLAG = 2 has been taken from the official tables provided
  by the LEP experts. For the time being they are available from the temporary
  ALEPH database ADBSTEST. They will be put in the ADBSCONS.DAF in its next
  release. See the ALPHA user's guide p. 15-16 to get the ADBSTEST database.
        
     N.B.   This routine makes no sense for LEP2 runs. For LEP2 runs, please 
            use the routine QELEP2 described in the ALPHA user's guide p. 118.

 2 - LEP energy and ALPHA variable QELEP :
d77 9
a85 8
  reasons, the QELEP variable giving the LEP energy was defined only once per
  LEP fill as the average energy for all good runs of the fill and taken from
  a database bank.

  The "instantaneous" energy made available by the LEP experts (for time slices
  of 15 minutes) for 1996 and 1997 LEP 2 runs, and the precise run-averaged
  LEP energies for LEP1 runs were available from the user-callable routines
  QELEP2 and QELEP1, the existence of which was ignored by a majority of users.

  compute the event interaction point (QFNDIP package) or the secondary vertices
  or b tags in the QIPBTAG package. As a result, the ALPHA variables for d0,z0  
  of charged tracks didn't match with the ones used inside these packages.

a185 10
  Remark : Nothing is changed for the use of the LEP BOMS
           obtained when using the data card BOBS
           (see the description in this NEWS file below,
           in the modifications done for the correction file ALPHA 122.41). 

    **  QFD0Z0 : modified to be called only if the data card 'D0NW'
                 is present and if one asks for the QFNDIP package.
        ===>     Be careful: the errors quoted on d0,z0 are not correct.
        ===>     Will be updated and fixed later.
        ===>     Should not be used for the time being.

  ** Name of ENFLW subroutine PRESEL changed to PRESELFW to avoid problems

a377 853
====================================================

  Correction file 122.30 released 24 Jun 1997
  Modifications w.r.t correction file ALPHA 122.29

  ** - Fix in subroutine KPCOMP to avoid problems in very long jobs        
       (bug found by M.Aleppo). 
 
  ** - Fix in subroutine FIXGAEN: remove skipping for MCarlo datasets
       which was introduced incorrectly in May 1996 (affects only 
       old 1992 Mcarlo datasets, bug found by M.Aleppo).
  
  ** - New KNTRU package for ENFLW/truth matching, from Paul Bright-Thomas.
       Described in detail in the new ALPHA user's guide, pp 92-93.

====================================================

  Correction file 122.29 released 21 May 1997
  Modifications w.r.t correction file ALPHA 122.28

  ** - Fix in subroutine QMPART to get correct modifications through 'PMOD' 
       data cards (correction provided by I.Tomalin)

  ** - Mod in QMNEWR to call MUNEWR only when reading POTs/DSTs

  ** - New QIPBTAG with improvements for the VDET 1996 :
       ( mods from J.Carr and M. Thulasidas) 
      
       modifications in QIPBTAG,TRSEL,FIT_DMIN
       new subroutines: BTAG_PAR96,FIT_DMIN96,CODSEL

       This new version of QIPBTAG allows to benefit from the improvements of
       the new 1996 VDET.
                                                                    
       For LEP 1 data or MCarlo (old VDET geometry) it is strictly equivalent
       to the old one.

       The improvements are called automatically when reading data from 1996
       (and 1997 in the future) or MCarlos with geometry year >= 1996.
       IF you are running on such data and if you still want the OLD QIPBTAG, 
       please put a data card  OQIP  in your CARDs file.   
       The improvements are not called for LEP 1 data or MCarlo, unless a new
       data card NQIP is present in the user's cards.

       See the presentation of M. Thulasidas during the January Aleph Software
       week for details on the new efficiency/purity of the b-tagging with the
       present improvements.
 
====================================================
 
  Correction file 122.28 released 15 May 1997
  Modifications w.r.t correction file ALPHA 122.26
 
  **  Some fixes or improvements provided by I. Tomalin:
      - New feature in KTLORx routines: tracks "with no attributes"
        can now be boosted.
      - Mod in QVCOPY to avoid further infinite loops in QVADDn routines.
      - Mod in QMRDSB to avoid reading empty events from EDIRs 
 
  **  New routine QEWSUM: gives the energy on ECAL wires summed over even/odd
      planes; these quantities could not be obtained from the MINI and are now
      available from a new bank, DWES, in MINI 103.
 
      The subroutine works indifferently on POTs, DSTs and MINIs
      (MINIs written with version >= 103 only).
 
      Calling sequence:
 
      CALL QEWSUM(EWEVEN,EWODD,IER)
 
      Output arguments:
      EWEVEN = sum of wire energies on even planes for the 36 ECAL modules
               (in GeV)
      EWODD  = sum of wire energies on  odd planes for the 36 ECAL modules
               (in GeV)
      EWEVEN and EWODD must be dimensioned to 36 in the calling routine
 
      IER    = 1 if no banks of wire energies for this event
             = 0 if all OK
 
=======================================================================
 
  Correction file 122.26 released 05 May 1997
  Modifications w.r.t correction file ALPHA 122.25
 
 
  **  Some fixes :
      - Fix in KCHT (protection against infinite loops)
      - The Routine QELEP2 for LEP 2 exact center-of-mass energy is now a
        simple interface to the new ALEPHLIB routine GETLE2, which gets the
        informations from banks of the ADBSCONS.DAF.
 
  **  Modifications to decode and access the new vertices from the new tracking
      =========================================================================
 
    - Decoding of new banks coming from the new tracking (JULIA 302)
      mods in  routine QFILL
 
      new routines QFILNV,QFKINK,QFYNVH,QFNINT,QNVSTO,QFYLV0
 
    - Modification in QWIVX
    - New user routines QVKINK,QKINKV,QKINKT,QNUCL,QLV0V,QLV0T
 
 All the following informations will be available exactly in the same way from
 ALPHA when reading a POT, a DST or a MINI.
 
  1 - New reconstructed vertices in ALPHA and their properties:
      --------------------------------------------------------
 
      The new vertices can be recognised through their "vertex type" :
         ITYP = KVTYPE(IVR)
 
      The classification of vertices types in ALPHA is now as follows:
 
         ITYP value    Nature of vertex
 
           1           Main vertex from JULIA of QFNDIP  }  these vertices
           0           V0 from the YV0V package          }  exist in ALPHA since
           2           Secondary Vertex fitted           }  ever
                       from any of the KVFITx routines   }
 
           3           "Long V0" vertex                  }
           4           Nuclear interaction vertex        }  these are the new
           5           Kink vertex on a charged track    }  vertices
 
 
      Having distinguished among the different vertex categories using ITYP,
      one gets the vertex properties through standard ALPHA variables:
 
    Variable         Meaning                     Comment
    --------         -------                     -------
 
    KVTYPE(IVR)      type of vertex, see above
    QVX(IVR)         X position , in cm          Available for
    QVY(IVR)         Y position , in cm              all
    QVZ(IVR)         Z position , in cm          ITYP values
 
    QVCHIF(IVR)      Chisquare of vertex fit     Not available for ITYP=0
                                                 and for Main Vertex from JULIA
    QVEM(IVX,N,M)    element N,M of covariant    Not available for ITYP=4,5
                     error matrix                and for Main Vertex from JULIA
    KVN(IVR)         Row number of vertex in
                     original bank
    KVNDAU(IVR)      Number of daughter tracks
    KVDAU(IVR,I)     ALPHA "track" number        "track" may be a "Long V0" in
                     of Ith daughter             the case of ITYP=4 vertices
    KVINCP(IVR)      ALPHA "track" incoming      may be a V0 or a "Long V0" or
                     to vertex IVR               a charged track ending at IVR
 
 
  2 - Access to the new vertices through DO loops:
      -------------------------------------------
 
      The new vertices described above can be accessed in ALPHA as follows:
 
      * "Long V0s" :
                         CALL QLV0V(KFLV0,KLLV0)
                         DO IVV = KFLV0,KLLV0
                            ....
                         ENDDO
 
      * Nuclear interactions:
                         CALL QNUCL(KFNIV,KLNIV)
                         DO IVV = KFNIV,KLNIV
                            ....
                         ENDDO
 
      * Kink vertices:
                         CALL QKINKV (KFKIV,KLKIV)
                         DO IVV = KFKIV,KLKIV
                            ....
                         ENDDO
 
      Please take note of the calls to subroutines QLV0V,QNUCL,QKINKV to get
      the loop limits, which cannot be stored in the #qcde include file.
 
  3 - Access to special informations for Kink vertices:
      ------------------------------------------------
 
      A new routine is provided to get special quantities associated with
      the new Kink vertices :
 
         IVR being the ALPHA vertex number of a "Kink vertex" :
 
      CALL QVKINK(IVR,Pkink,ptout,plout,ihypk,ier)
 
   Input argument :
      IVR  = ALPHA vertex number for the kink vertex
   Output arguments :
      IER  = 0 if IVR is really an ALPHA kink vertex
           = 1 if not
    If IER = 0 , the following quantities are defined :
   Pkink   = Momentum of parent at kink position
   Ptout   = Pt of outgoing charged particle relative to parent
   Plout   = Pl of outgoing charged particle relative to parent
   IHYPK   = Hypothesis of mass cuts satisfied by this decay.
           = 1   pi -> mu nu
           = 2   K -> mu nu
           = 3   K -> pi pi0
           = 4   Sigma+ -> p pi0
           = 5   Sigma+ -> pi+ n
           = 6   Sigma- -> pi- n
           = 7   Xi- -> pi- Lambda
           = 8   Omega- -> K- Lambda
           = 9   Omega- -> pi- Xi0
           = 10  Omega- -> Xi- pi0
           = 0   if none of the above hypotheses are satisfied
 
  4 - Relationships between ALPHA "tracks" and the new vertices:
      ---------------------------------------------------------
 
     The standard track-vertex relationships :
      IVX = KORIV(ITK)   origin vertex of reconstructed charged track ITK
      IVX = KENDV(ITK)   end    vertex of reconstructed charged track ITK
     have been updated for the new vertices and their incoming/outgoing "tracks"
 
      ITK may be:
      - an ALPHA charged reconstructed track (ITK = KFCHT,KLCHT)
 
      - a standard "V0 track" decaying at a V0 vertex from YV0V
           (ITK = KFV0T,KLV0T)
 
      - a "Long V0 track"  decaying at a "Long V0" vertex
           New ALPHA "tracks" are defined for these "Long V0 tracks"; they are
           stored in consecutive order and may be accessed via the call
           to a new subroutine:
                   CALL QLV0T(KFLVT,KLLVT)
                   DO ITK = KFLVT , KLLVT
                      ...
                   ENDDO
 
  5 - New routine to get the list of charged tracks ending in a kink vertex:
      ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 
           These tracks are already part of ALPHA standard charged tracks;
           they must be treated with special care since they never go to the
           calorimeters.
           To access them easily, a new subroutine QKINKT is provided, which
           returns the number and list of ALPHA charged reconstructed tracks
           ending in a Kink vertex in an event:
 
              The list of tracks is returned in an array which must be dimen-
              sioned properly in the calling routine:
 
                   INTEGER LISTKINKT(50)
 
                   CALL QKINKT(NKINKS,LISTKINKT)
                   DO I = 1,NKINKS
                      ITK=LISTKINKT(I)
                      ....
                   ENDDO
 
  6 - Standard Printout of informations:
      ---------------------------------
      The standard ALPHA printout routines (QWIVX,QWITK) have been modified
      to deal with the new vertices and "tracks" described above.

  Correction file 122.24 released 25 Mar 1997
  Modifications w.r.t correction file ALPHA 122.23
 
  **  New routine, QELEP2, to get the "instantaneous" LEP energy
      for high-energy events taken in 1996,
      as described in the Aleph note from Paul Bright-Thomas:
 
      "LEP Energy for 1996 High-Energy Data", ALEPH 97/029, PHYSIC 97/024
       (20 March 1997).
 
      This routine has to be called by the user for each event:
 
              CALL QELEP2(ENERGY,IFLAG)
 
       It gives 2 output arguments:
 
  If IFLAG = 1     ENERGY (in GeV) is the "instantaneous" center-of-mass
                   LEP energy ( in Gev) as defined above.
                   It is available ONLY for high energy runs of 1996, not for
                   the runs taken at the Z0 peak for calibration.
 
     IFLAG = 2     ENERGY (in GeV) is the average energy of the corresponding
                   run, when the "instantaneous" energy is not available. This
                   occurs for about 2% of the triggers taken at high energy in
                   1996.
 
     IFLAG = 3     ENERGY = QELEP (in GeV) for all other cases: LEP1 runs,
                   MCarlo runs, runs at the Z0 peak for 1996.
 
  The information for IFLAG = 1 has been taken from the official tables provided
  by the LEP experts, and put in a temporary way in the dbas.bank file read by
  ALPHA at initialisation time. It will be put in the ADBSCONS DAF in a near
  future, and the modification will be transparent to the users.

  - Remove of an old "patch" in QMNEWR, which was put in Summer 1995 for
    LEP 1.5 data when the VDET alignment was not satisfactory.
    The effect of this patch was to use by default the charged tracks
    WITHOUT VDET hits when reading a POT/DST - to get the tracks
    WITH VDET hits a data card FRF2 was needed.
 
    As a result, up to now the default charged tracks obtained in ALPHA for
    LEP 1.5 data were not exactly the same when reading the same event on
    a POT/DST or on a MINI (since on the MINI only tracks WITH VDET hits were
    written). The difference on the momentum could be 1 to 4%.
 
    Another problem is the following: the EFLOW objects written on the MINI have
    been done using charged tracks WITHOUT VDET hits.
 
    After this correction, the situation is as follows:
 
    * when reading the same event on POT/DST or on the MINI, the charged tracks
      obtained by default with ALPHA are exactly the same (WITH VDET hits).
 
    * the EFLOW objects on the MINIs are still the ones made with charged tracks
      WITHOUT VDET hits. These MINIs will be redone in a near future. For the
      time being the only way to obtain EFLOW objects with charged tracks WITH
      VDET is to rerun ENFLW on the POT or DST events.
 
  - Another problem on LEP 1.5 data is solved:
    Due to DAQ problems, TPC laser events were not always correctly flagged
    in the event trigger bits and could be obtained in "standard" events,
    giving very strange results!
    They are now rejected at the XLUMOK level (please don't call XLUMOK your-
    self: use the ALPHA logical variable XHVTRG instead, as explained
    in the ALPHA user's guide).
 
  - Since Summer 1995, the bits 0 and 1 of the word  "Dead zone pattern" in the
    FRID bank, telling if a track intersects or not the VDET layers 1 and 2,
    were not filled in JULIA. For ALPHA track #I, this word is accessed through
    the function KFRIDZ(I) in ALPHA.
 
    A new ALPHA routine, written by A.Bonissent, is provided now.
    It allows to know the status of these bits and works on POT,DST and MINI:
 
    CALL QXTRAP(ITK,LAY1,LAY2)
 
    Input argument   :  ITK = ALPHA charged track number
    Output arguments :  LAY1 = 0 if track does not intersect VDET layer 1
                             = 1 if it does intersect the active region 1
                        LAY2 = same for VDET layer 2

  Modifications w.r.t correction file ALPHA 122.21
 
  - Protection added in QFMCPA : at least 2 events of the 1994 MC production
    (more than 10**7 events) caused a crash in QFILL, due to a weird track
    with Px=Py=Pz=0. Mod. by J.Boucrot, thanks to D.Jaffe and P.Bright-Thomas
    who found the events.
 
  - Modifications in QSELEP, thanks to G. Taylor and N.Konstantinidis:
      - change the default value of R5 to allow dE/dx cut to be made according
        to the user's choice in data card LSEC
      - Allow the data card LSMC to work as indicated - previously, whatever
        flags were asked for by the user in the LSMC card, only muons with
        QMUIDO flags 13 and 14 were kept.

  - Bug fix in the newly introduced routine FIXPRL (from P.Perret).
 
========================================================================
 
  Correction file 122.20 released  19 Feb.  1997
  Modifications w.r.t correction file ALPHA 122.19
 
  - Fix in routine QFLEPT (in QSELEP):
      When reading a MINI and calling QSELEP with changed cuts: if no leptons
      were found with the new cuts, the ALPHA variables for the leptons were
      not properly updated and were kept as read from the MINI bank PDLT.
 
  - In subroutine QFILL : call to new routine FIXPRL to correct the electron
    identification estimator R_l for 1996 Monte-Carlo. FIXPRL, written by
    Pascal Perret, modifies the estimator IF and only IF a data card :
    UPRL
    is put in the user's ALPHA CARDs file. Then the ALPHA variable
    QEIDRI(I,3) is filled for ALPHA track number I with the new value of R_l
    for 1996 Monte-Carlo events. Previous Monte-Carlo productions, as well as
    real data, are unaffected.
    See the Aleph note from P. Perret (ALEPH 97-017, SOFTWR 97-002) for more
    details.
 
  - Modifications in XPTENB (part of XLUMOK) from Brigitte Bloch.
    Allows to handle correctly the events which are LCAL trigger only
    in 1996. However the informations concerning LCAL only triggers
    was not put by JULIA in the LUPA bank: the correction will be
    really effective for 1997 data and for 1996 in case of reprocessing.

 1 -  New routine MCMATCH for MC charged track matching :
      ================================================
 
      Previously in UPHY ; written by D. Brown and P. Rensing .
      Reference : D. Brown , ALEPH 94-135 ( PHYSIC 94-118) , July 1994
      Good tracks are classified according to the origin of the true track

 2 -  New routine JULMATCH for MC charged track matching :
      =================================================
 
      Previously in UPHY ; written by D. Brown and P. Rensing .
      Reference : D. Brown , ALEPH 94-135 ( PHYSIC 94-118) , July 1994
      Good tracks are classified according to the origin of the true track
 
      Calling sequence :
 
      CALL JULMATCH(IALTRK,IMCTRK,IFLAG)
 
      Input argument :
       IALTRK =  Input ALPHA track number ( Charged tracks only ! )
      Output arguments :

          Note: IMCTRK is returned zero for IFLAG <= -2
 
 
 3 -  New routine VDHMATCH for MC charged track matching :
      =================================================
 
      Previously in UPHY ; written by D. Brown and P. Rensing .
      Reference : D. Brown , ALEPH 94-135 ( PHYSIC 94-118) , July 1994
      Count matching VDET hits for a given reconstructed/MCtrue track.
 
      The association of recontructed with MC track must have already
      been done (for example, by calling JULMATCH).
 
      This routine works ONLY when reading POT / DST files :
      ====>  THIS ROUTINE CANNOT WORK ON MINIS
 
      Calling sequence :
 
      CALL VDHMATCH(IALTRK,IMCTRK,NTRUE,NWRONG,NMISS,NDOUBLE)
 
   Input arguments :
    IALTRK  =  ALPHA track number of RECONSTRUCTED track
    IMCTRK  =  ALPHA track number of associated MONTE CARLO track
               ( as given by JULMATCH )
 
   Output arguments :
    NTRUE   =  # of true VDET hits on this track
    NWRONG  =  # of hits on reconstructed track which truely came from
                a track other than IMCTRK (split z/rphi)
    NMISS   =  # of true hits not used in reconstruction (split z/rphi)
    NDOUBLE =  # of hits on reconstructed track which are associated
                with >=2 MC true tracks (split z/rphi)
 
 4 -  New routine TXTREE :
      ==================
 
      Previously in UPHY ; written by A.Bonissent .
      Produce a LaTex source file of the decay tree from a MCarlo event.
 
      Calling sequence :
 
      CALL TXTREE(MOTHU,OPT)
 
      Input arguments :
       MOTHU : the ALPHA track number where the tree will start
       OPT   : a character string ;
               if it includes 'TRACK#', the ALPHA track number will be
               be displayed as well as the particle's name
               If not, only the particle's code will appear
 
     Output : A file txtree.tex is produced and updated at each
              call. It is also closed at each call, so that it can be
              LaTexed at any time .
              A new file will be created at each job .
              On VAXes the file is put automatically on the scweek: directory
 
 Here is an example of how to use it :
    Find the index of a psi
       N=KPDIR('JPSI',KMONTE)
    Find the mother of the psi
       MOTH=KMOTH(N,1)
    Produce the tree (labels only)
       CALL TXTREE(MOTH,'    ')
    Produce the tree (labels and track number)
       CALL TXTREE(MOTH,'TRACK#')
 
 
 5 -  New routine QPADX for the pad dE/dx :
      ===================================
 
     New routine QPADX , interface to the new pad dE/dx subroutine
     of the ALEPHLIB ( TPDHYP ) , from Dave Casper .
 
     The calling sequence is almost the same as QDEDX , with a difference :
     the output argument XNS is not an Integer as in QDEDX.
 
 
     CALL QPADX(ITK,N,RMASS,QH,RI,XNS,TL,RIEXP,SIGMA,IER)
 
      Input arguments :
               ITK      /I       ALPHA track number
               N        /I       Number of hypothesis to try
               RMASS(n) /R       Mass hypotheses
               QH(n)    /R       Charge hypotheses (sign doesn't matter)
 
      Output arguments :
               RI       /R       Measured ionization (1.O=minion, Q=1)
               XNS      /R       Number of useful wire samples on track
               TL       /T       Useful length of the track (cm)
               RIEXP(n) /R       Expected ionization for the given
                                 mass hypothesis (1.0=minion, Q=1)
               SIGMA(n) /R       Sigma of dE/dx measurement error,
                                 including the momentum error.
                                 Note that one can calculate a
                                 chi-squared with 1 d.o.f. as:
                                 chi2 = ((RI-RIEXP)/SIGMA)**2
               IER      /I       Error return code :
                                 0 = success
                                 1 = can't find track bank or not
                                     a reconstructed charged track
                                 2 = can't find dE/dx bank
                                 3 = track has no dE/dx information
                                 4 = can't find calibration banks
                                     TC1X, TC2X, TP3X and/or TC3X
                                 5 = cannot find RUNH or EVEH bank
                                     from which to get the run number
                                 6 = can't find TCSX,TCGX banks
                                 7 = not supported on nano-dst
 
 6 - Modifications in the QIPBTAG package ( S. Schael ) :
     ==================================================
 
     - Modification in QIPBTAG  : the  b-tagging probability per jet is
       available now for more than 3 jets per event . The user has to
       put a new data card NUMJ njet  in his CARDS file . For example :
 NUMJ 4
       will force QIPBTAG to calculate the b-tagging probability for
       the first 4 jets of the event ( ordered by energy ) . Up to now ,
       QIPBTAG was always doing the calculations for the first 3 jets only .
 
     - double precision for some variables in V0KINE , needed on some
       platforms
     - same cut on jet momentum ( 10 Gev ) everywhere in the QIPBTAG
       and QFNDIP packages .
 
     - protections added in QFNDV0, BTAGEV
 
     - Mod in QIPBTCPU : this timing routine for QIPBTAG is executed
       only if the user puts a data card  'QITI' in the CARDS file .
       This is done to save CPU time due to the calls to TIMED .
 
 7 -  New handling of the Monte-Carlo "new" particles :
      ===============================================
 
       When reading a Monte-Carlo dataset where more particles than the
       "standard" ALPHA list are available : the definition of these new
       particles is now read from the 'PART' bank and put into ALPHA
       variables in one go , in the run initialisation . In the previous
       versions this was done only one particle after the other , when
       reading events with any "new" particle in it .
            The mass of these new particles is now transmitted and availa-
       ble through the statements QCMASS(icode) or QPMASS('part_name') .
            The number of particles which may be handled by the ALPHA
       XPEQxx  routines has been increased from 500 to 2000 .
 
 8 -  Other Modifications :
      ===================
 
      ** New QDECL , QHAC and QCDE Include Files . The modifications are
         user-transparent and concern the Real/Integer declaration of some
         bank parameters , which were migrated from QDECL to QCDE in view
         of the future ALPHA maintenance under CVS .
 
      ** The bank formats are now read from the ALEPHLIB routine ALFMT .
         When reading a MINI , if the formats are not OK , the job is
         stopped .
 
      ** Fixes in the QSELEP package :
         - remove the tight cut on LEP energy ; activate properly the
           QSELEP data cards when reading a MINI ;
         - Modification in QTRUTH : Fixes in several internal routines
           ( GEN,ISP,CHECKQ ) and new function ENDCH , to avoid endless
           loops in certain circumstances .
 
      ** Mod in KVGOOD : corrections needed  for LEP 1 runs of 1995
 
      ** Small fixes in QFGET_BP , QMCHI2 , QMNEWR
                        and in ENFLW routines BUILDAL , EXTRHC , PRESEL
 
      ** Sign of Thrust axis now fixed in QGTHRU to get exactly the
         same results on all platforms
 
      ** All the 18 users flags are now cleared in QMCLR for all tracks .
 
      ** Protection added in QFMCBM to avoid crashes on some LEP II MCarlos.
 
      ** Error matrix correctly set for ENFLW charged objects ( mod in QFEFLO )
 
      ** All WRITE statements inside ALPHA are done now on LUN = IW(6)
 
      ** All *IFs of the Historian Library have been changed to prepare
         the future switching under the CVS source code manager .

  Modifications w.r.t correction file ALPHA 112.07  :

  ** In QMRDSB : do not check class word of events with only 1 bank
                 (laser events) but do not skip them

  ** In QDATA  : set LUFORM to 77 instead of 93

  ** In QHMOST : Add a protection for corrupted PHST banks

  ** In QUEFLO, QUPEC1, QMUNEW, QUMUPR : take the code from ALENFLW.F 
     protected with an #if defined(ALEPH_JULIA).
     When linking ALPHA WITH JULIA these 4 routines are recompiled with
     ALEPH_JULIA defined.

     LEP 1.5 data : the FRFT 2 track bank ( WITH VDET ) will be now used        
     by default for these data (instead of FRFT 0: tracks without VDET).

  ** New routine QVTRUH to provide the number of correctly associated           
     VDET hits per layer for a given track (MCarlo only !). This information    
     is intended to be put in the future MINIs. Provisionnally two other        
     routines are put in the ALPHA correction file : a modified version         
     of the MINI routine MINTRA and the routine VTRUH , which will go           
     respectively in the MINILIB and in the ALEPHLIB in the future.

========================================================================
                             ALPHA 121 News
                        Last Update:  11 Oct.  1995
========================================================================

  New version of ALPHA : ALPHA 121 , released for test on 28 August 1995
  New test version released on September 27 1995 .

========================================================================

  Modifications w.r.t  ALPHA 120 :


 1 -  New NANO writing package , from G. Graefe :
      =========================================

      NANODSTs can be now written from an ALPHA job .

      - Mods in QMINIT,QMTERM,QMNEWR,QMCARD,QWRITE,QFEFLO,QVSRCH,QVSTVA
      - Mods in NANFIL,NREFKI,NREFRF,NREGOO,NREPGP,NREPYE,QNINFO
      - New routines  GETNAV,NREBYT,NREEOB,NRELE,NVSRCH,NVSTVA
      - MANY modifications in the NANO comdecks ;
      - New comdecks  NDCLJJ,NDOBJJ,NEHEJJ,NCOMOB,NCOMSR

      The author should be consulted to use this new facility , which will be
      properly documented in the forthcoming new ALPHA User's Guide 120/121 .

 2 -  New code for the Beam Spot ( GET_BP) , from S. Wasserbaech :
      ==========================================================

      Warning ! The ADBSCONS database  >= 198 has to be used in order to
      benefit from the improvements described below . Please refer to the
      ALPHA 120/121 user's guide for more details .

    - New auxiliary file BEAM POSITION containing :
        * fixes to 1991/1993 data
        * new bank ALP1  for 1994 data
        * new banks WIDE and WIDN for the "metachunks" used for the luminous
          region .

    - QFGET_BP : lots of changes :
      to allow access to 1993 beam positions from BEAM POSITION for old proces-
      sings ( done in 1993/1994 ) and from ALPB banks for the 1995 reprocessing
      and beam position for 1994/1995 data from ALPB banks.  Two new entry point
      QFGET_CH and QFMCSX added.
    - QMNEWR : call FIXALPB for each new run.
    - QMDBAS : print correct message about reading BEAM POSITION.

      New routines added :
    - FIXALPB : repair ALPB banks which were incorrectly written by Julia.
      This is intended to operate only on 1994 data.  It requires the
      ALP1 bank which is inside BEAM POSITION.
    - XFMCBP : handling of MC setup for chunk beam position and size
    - QBEAMX  : metachunk size of luminous region in x direction .

 3 -  New code to call the PVM vector facility on SAGA machines :
      =========================================================

      This vector facility works only on the CERN SAGA cluster and one has
      to ask for the loading of the PVM library when executing alpharun .

    - mods in routines QMCARD,QMINIT,QMRDSB,QMTERM,QWRITE,QWTIME
    - new routines QPVMCD,QPVMEN,QPVMES,QPVMEX,QPVMGT,QPVMIM,QPVMIS,
                   QPVMOF,QPVMTE,QPVMTI,QPVMWR
      These routines are dummy in the ALPHA library ; the operating
      routine are loaded from the appropriate library if asked in
      alpharun .

 4 -  Modifications to the QIPBTAG package :
      ====================================

    - Mod in QFNDV0 , replace the call to QDEDXM by a call to QDEDX
    - Various mods in QFNDV0 to protect against divides by 0. on rare events
    - Protections in FIT_DMIN to avoid crashes during the fit
    - Minor fixes in TRSEL and QIPBTAG .
    - New feature : if you want to know where QIPBTAG is spending its CPU
      time : call QIPBTCPU('SUMMARY',2) at the end of your program.
    - The origin of the different performance of the old UPHY QIPBTAG
      w.r.t the ALPHA version has been found by I. Tomalin . It is an
      effective lifetime cut which in the UPHY version was more powerful
      in reducing  charm background . This cut is defined in a data
      statement   DATA L_SCUT in the subroutine BTAG_PAR :

 ALPHA 120.04 and before             UPHY                 ALPHA 120.05
 DATA L_SCUT /5*2.0,5*3.0/   DATA L_SCUT /5*1.0,5*1.0/   DATA L_SCUT /10*1.3/


 5 -  New data card 'NOSC' for SiCAL clusters in ENFLW objects :
      ========================================================

   ** New data card 'NOSC' to remove SiCAL clusters from ENFLW objects :
      mods in QFEFLO,BUILDAL,ENFJET,GAMIXED,MDSTRD

      New feature :  possibility of removing the SiCAL clusters from ENFLW
      objects, simply by adding a 'NOSC' card in the datacards.
      It works on POT/DST/MINI/MICRO.

      *** Warning ***  : When you write MINIs from DST/POT with NOSC,
      the SiCAL clusters will NOT be saved on the MINIs and will
      NOT be recovered on the MINIs even without NOSC. This is OK
      for private productions ; the official MINIs will continue to
      be produced with the SICAL clusters in energy flow objects , as before .


 6 -  Modifications to ENFLW due to the new trigger code :
      ===================================================

   ** Restore the consistency between ALEPHLIB and ENFLW for
      what concerns the trigger processing: Use bank X1RG
      when available, and use the modified COMMONs for
      SUBROUTINE X1DISC.
   **  Add some facilities to ENFLW utility routines.

 7 -  Other Modifications :
      ===================

   ** JCAR bank suppressed from the 'C' list before writing an output file
      Several runs of 1994 had a huge ( 200000 words ! ) 'JCAR' bank , cor-
      responding to ECAL endcap corrections . This bank was written on the
      output run header , resulting in useless huge files .

   ** EFLJ is now forced when the user asks for QFND . A lot of  QIPBTAG
      or QFNDIP users forgot to put this card , and as a result they got
      no interaction point .

  **  The "No beam position" message for runs which don't have yet the run-
      by-run beam position  is suppressed . This run-by-run beam position
      is now almost completely useless since most people use the beam-chunk
      beam position .

  **  Fixes for UNIX compilers in XVDEOK,ENFLJ,QVDHIT,QLINIT,FIXALPB

  **  Corrections to deal with the new 1995  ECAL Wires bank PWEI :
        - in BKINI ( ENFLW package )
        - in QFILL,QFECWD

  **  Protections against crazy "ITC only" tracks of 1995 data in QFCHGD

  **  Correction in QFREV0 to build a main vertex with the QFNDIP
      results , if any , when JULIA failed to find a main vertex .
      This concerns CLAS 16 events only , and happens for about 1.5
      per mil of CLAS 16 events .

  **  Correct definition of the track error matrix in QVSETM

  **  Bug fix in routine CORAOL2 ( caused crashes on UNIX HP machines )

  **  Mod in FIXGAEN for the 1993 data reprocessing

  **  Mod in QMNEWR to initialise the VDET geometry
