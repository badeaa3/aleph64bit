      SUBROUTINE VDMKLA(ITK,XIN,XOUT,NDIM,EREL,XEL,EL,NSTEP)
C!----------------------------------------------------------------------
C! Make Landau track elements
CKEY VDET DIGITIZE
C!
C! Given the GEANT track number, entry-exit points to the wafer face,
C! (ie, a track segment), compute small track segments (NSTEP of them.)
C!
C!  Author         Manoj Thulasidas 15-Mar-1994

C!  Description
C!  ===========
C!  VDMKLA is to make small track elements with LANDAU fluctuations.
C!  We know that a significant part of the VDET resolution comes from
C!  the non-uniformity of the energy deposit as the track traverses
C!  the wafer.  More significantly, the cos(theta) dependence of the
C!  the resolution is almost entirely due to these LANDAU fluctuations.
C!  (A future ALEPH note reference here).
C!  A detailed study showed that the following procedure will reproduce
C!  the test beam data well:
C!  1) Make as many divisions as necessary to have a maximum projection
C!     of 10micron (for each division either in z or r-phi view) in length
C!  2) Take each division and fluctuate the energy according to the L.
C!     distribution.
C!  3) Normalize the total energy to the totaly energy lost by the track
C!     already given by GEANT.
C!
C!  The call to the subroutine that actually produces the Landau
C!  fluctuations is controlled by a data card VNOL.
C!  i.e. if VNOL is present among the Job control cards, the
C!  result of this subroutine would be without any Landua fluctuations.
C!
C!  NOTES:
C!     - This step is done AFTER GEANT tracking is done.  Experience
C!       taught us that dividing the wafer into smaller GEANT volumes
C!       is not the way to go - too expensive in CPU time.
C!     - The energy lost computed by GEANT is already a L. distribution.
C!       Subdividing it may not be mathematically rigorous and might
C!       lead to subtle effects, somebody will have to study that in
C!       detail, later.
C!
C! Input :  ITK  -  GEANT track number, needed to know what particle it is
C!          XIN  -  Entry point to the wafer
C!          XOUT -  Exit point
C!          NDIM -  Maximum number of steps allowed. ie, dimension of the
C!                  arrays in the calling routine
C!          EREL -  Total energy lost by the track segment as given by
C!                  GEANT.
C!
C! Output : XEL   - Midpoints of each small track segment (3,NSTEP)
C!          EL    - Energy deposited by each small tr.seg. (NSTEP)
C!          NSTEP - Number is steps.  (Average is around 15-16)
