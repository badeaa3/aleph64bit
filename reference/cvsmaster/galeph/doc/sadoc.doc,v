.chapter SMALL ANGLE TRACKING DETECTOR
.section INTRODUCTION
                                         H.Burkhardt  May 87
    The SATR detector measures the tracks of charged particles
    before they enter the Luminosity Calorimeter. The geometry
    and readout is optimized to obtain good resolution in theta.
    The acceptance region is 47 - 92 mrad in theta and full
    acceptance in phi. There are two identical detectors
    on either side of the interaction region in the z-range
    from 245.4 to 262.5 cm.
.section DESCRIPTION OF SUBROUTINES
  SAASIG
    This routine reduces the SAHI bank in case of multihits on the same
    wire. Only the hit closest to the wire is kept
  ..................................................
  SABOOK
    Histogram booking for the SATR. The histograms 601-615 allow to
    determine: how many electrons produce showers already in
    the beam pipe before they enter the SATR and by how
    much they change the measurement of theta. To do this
    information fromn the ITC and SATR impact bank is needed.
    They other histograms allow a study of the shower development
    inside the SATR (representing about 67 rad. length) through
    hit and wire statitics per layer. Since multihits are not resolved
    and certain wires put on the same TDC this study can only be
    done in Monte Carlo.
  ..................................................
  SADIGI
    Evaluates the information from the SAHIt bank, does oring
    of wires going to the same TDC and the digitizing to simulate
    real data.
  ..................................................
  SAGROU
    Calculate the sector group number from the sector number.
    Called from SADIGI as part of the conversion from wire number
    to readout numbering.
  ..................................................
  SAHIST
    Fill histograms for the SATR. Most useful in runs with single gammas
    or electrons or Bhabha generators producing particles in the SATR
    fiducial region.
  ..................................................
  SAHIT
    Calculate hit and fill SAHI bank whenever a charged particle traverses
    an active SATR volume.
  ..................................................
  SAIRUN
    initialize common variables and banks for the SATR
  ..................................................
  SAWSUM
    Prints out the average averages. For a test run use single electrons
    or positrons in the cost range from .9968 - .9990 ( 45-80 mrad).
    Reducing the fiducial volume in r to 50 cm and in z to 300 cm
    100 events can be generated in a few minutes of running.
                               minimum   maximum   typical
    number of events               10
    average #hits sens. region      5         60       40
    average #hits lost              0         10        5
    average #wires set              5         30       12
