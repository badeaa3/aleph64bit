.chapter GEOMETRY   implementation using GEANT3

     The detector geometry is described  in  terms  of  volumes  in  which  the
  tracking  is  performed  according  to  the  tracking parameters of the media
  filling the volumes.  The basic concepts needed to define a  volume  are  the
  following:

       -SHAPE identification specifying the geometrical shape (tube,cone,box..)
              and its dimensions in the attached local reference system  LRS.
       -TRACKING MEDIUM  parameters  to be associated with a particular volume.
       -PHYSICAL PROPERTIES of the material which fills the volume.

     Furthemore, as long as it is not positionned in the ALEPH reference system
  ARS, a volume is an entity  without  any  spatial  relation  with  the  ALEPH
  set-up.

     Full details about the GEOMETRY package of GEANT3 can  be  found  in  the
  GEANT3 users guide (DD/EE/84-1).


.section VOLUME   definition and position

     Each detector or component of a detector has to be defined as a VOLUME
 qualified by:
      NAME :   unique 4-character name
     SHAPE :   4-character name of a system supplied shape
               if necessary,one can add new shapes
      NMED :   tracking medium number corresponding to this volume
       PAR :   array containing the volume parameters
      NPAR :   number of parameters to be used (may be 0)

     By convention , a unique initial volume is defined as a TUBE  named  ALEF,
  matching  the  outside boundaries of the entire set-up.  The reference system
  attached to this volume is the ALEPH reference system ARS.

     Inside this initial volume , contents  will  be  positionned  ,  becoming
  daughters of the mother volume.
     The daughters can become ,in the same way, a mother  for  their  contents
  and  so  on...  These operations will develop a tree structure of volumes at
  deeper and deeper levels (up to 15 are allowed).
     The tracking medium properties of the contents replace the  ones  of  the
  mother within the region they occupy.

     Each shape has a local reference system LRS  whose  origin  and  axes  are
  those defined for this particular shape :
        - polycone   : cylindrical coord., the origin can be chosen by the user
                       along the z-axis.
        - tube       : cylindrical coord., the origin is at the center.
        - box        : cartesian coord.,   the origin is at the center.
        - trapezoide : cartesian coord.,   the origin is at the center.

     In order to position a volume of given  shape  and  dimensions  inside  a
  mother  volume, the user must specify the translation and the rotation of the
  local reference system with respect to the mother reference system.
  x,y,z :  position of the origin of the local reference system in the mother
           reference system
  irot  :  rotation matrix number describing the orientation of the local
           reference system with respect to the mother reference system.
           If no rotation is needed,irot can be set to 0.

.section THE ALEF TREE

     Here is a description of the tree implemented in this primary version
 of the program.

  Naming convention : all volume names should start with the two letters code
 of the detector they are connected to ,that is to recall them:
   VD  : for Vertex detector
   IT  : for ITC detector
   TP  : for TPC detector
   EC  : for e-gamma detector
   HC  : for hadron detector
   LC  : for Luminosity calorimeter detector
   SI  : for Silicon calorimeter detector
   MU  : for Muon detector
   CO  : for Coil components
   BP  : for Beam pipe elements
   QU  : for Super quadrupole elements
   PM  : for Passive material ( cables, electronics,...)
   TS  : for trigger scintillator elements

     The first level (ALEF mother volume) and  the  second  level  (artificial
  volumes  containing real detectors) are described in the main routine of the
  geometry package :AGEOME .

.subsection AGEOME   Overall geometry

     LEVEL 1 :  The MOTHER volume is defined as a TUBE named ALEF filled  with
  air inside coil field (AIF).

     LEVEL 2 :  Real detectors are grouped into artificial  volumes  to  reduce
  the  search through the ALEF tree at tracking time.  Each of them corresponds
  roughly to a part of the  apparatus.   The  contents  of  these  volumes  are
  defined  in routines specific to the detector involved (i.e.  content VDET of
  volume CDET will be defined in routine AGVDET).
  These artificial volumes are of type 'polycone'  or  'tube' .
  Their z-axis  coincides  with the ALEF tube axis.  Their LRS origin coincides
  (for the moment) with the ARS origin.
  The artificial volumes containing the end-caps B are  positionned  by  a  180
  degrees rotation around Y axis of the corresponding end-caps A.

                     translation, and the same Z length. It's the space
                     needed by the physical modules of the  Mini-Vertex
                     inner barrel. Its radii are calculated accordingly.
                     Filled with medium #1, it is not seen.
   1.1.2b- VDL2....: Same as VDL1, but for the outer barrel instead.
   1.2.1 - VDCF....: Tube placed  inside VDSP  with no  rotation and  Z
                     translated  to its inner end,  thus touching VDS0.
                     It  is  the support rings  that keep  in place the
                     barrel sides.  Filled with medium #4 it is seen by
                     the drawing package.
   1.2.2 - VDS1....: Tube placed  inside VDSP  with no rotation and a Z
                     traslation. It is part of the support, filled with
                     medium #2 and seen.
   1.2.3 - VDS2....: Tube placed inside  VDSP  with no rotation and a Z
                     translation.  It is the long  lateral part  of the
                     support,  joining the central part to the aluminum
                     pipe holders. Filled with medium #3 and seen.
   1.2.4 - VDS3....: Cone placed inside  VDSP  with no rotation and a Z
                     translation.  It is filled with medium #2 and lies
                     between VDS1 and VDS2. Seen.
   1.2.5 - VDAC....: Tube placed inside  VDSP  with no rotation and a Z
                     translation.  It is the aluminum ring right at the
                     end of the support  and  holds to the pipe.  It is
                     filled with medium #6 and seen.
   1.1.2.1 - VDBX..: Box  defining the space of a single side of a Mini
                     Vertex barrel. Its length and width are those of a
                     physical module, as defined in the Data Base, just
                     like its thickness, that of a silicon crystal plus
                     the alumina support.  It is filled  with medium #1
                     and not seen.  Several copies of  VDBX  are placed
                     inside VDL1 (currently 12) and VDL2 (currently 16)
                     translated along R and rotated along Z.  Note that
                     in the inner barrel the silicon is facing the beam
                     axis,  while in the outer  barrel it is facing the
                     outside.
   1.1.2.1.1 - VDAL: Box defining the alumina support of a side.  It is
                     filled with medium #6 and placed inside  VDBX with
                     the  same  length  and  width.  Its  thickness  is
                     computed outside  the  program taking into account
                     the true thickness,  the holes and the reinforcing
                     bars that are not  detailed described in the monte
                     carlo. It is seen by the drawing package.
   1.1.2.1.2 - VDCD: Box  defining silicon crystals ( active elements )
                     of the Mini Vertex. It's filled with medium #5 and
                     placed in  VDBX  with the same width.  This volume
                     is  actually  made  of  four  crystals,  but  this
                     subdivision  is  only  taken  into account  in the
                     digitization part  of the montecarlo.  Seen by the
                     drawing package.
   1.1.2.1.3 - VDEL: Box defining  preamplifier  chips and  their frame
                     in a barrel side.  It is filled with medium #7 and
                     its  dimension are equivalent  dimensions computed
                     from the true complicated structure  of the thing.
                     Two copies of it are placed in  VDBX at each Z end
                     of the active zone VDCD. Seen.
