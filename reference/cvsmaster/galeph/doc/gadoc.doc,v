.chapter INTRODUCTION

  - The version is maintained on VAX8600 and on IBM/MVS under HISTORIAN

  - To extract the documentation it is enough to run an Historian job
    to get a full compile file with the flag DOC on.
    on the VAX the procedure is as follow:
      $ HISTOR P=galeph.HLB,C=galeph.doc,F,D
        get the usual blabla from HISTORIAN , then type :
      *DEFINE,DOC
       ctrl Z
    The file galeph.doc will contain the header of each subroutines.
    To select a part of the documentation do the following:
       $ HISTOR P=galeph.HLB,C=galeph.DOC,Q,D,K
       *DF DOC
       *E FILDOC.CONTACT  get general doc., steering doc, geom. doc
                          and list of contact people.
        ctrl Z
      In this example you will suppress the description of individual
      subroutines.

  - Following rules have been applied to the writing:

     1. - The HLB is organized in SETS. All routines in a SET start
          with 2-letter code :
          following groups are defined:
            - group ASxxxx      (Aleph Simulation)
          contains all steering routines, I/O routines. All subroutine
          names start with AS .
            - group AGxxxx       (Aleph Geometry using Geant3)
          contains all geometry routines: deck names are made of AGzz,
          zz stands for the 2 letter-code of a detector.
            - group Cxxxxx       (CAlorimetry routines)
            - group Exxxxx       (ECal routines)
            - group Gxxxxx       (replacement of Geant routines,
                                  and GUser routines)
            - group Hxxxxx       (HCal routines)
            - group Ixxxxx       (ITC  routines)
            - group Lxxxxx       (LCal routines)
            - group Mxxxxx       (MUon chamber routines)
            - group Sxxxxx       (SiCAL routines)
            - group Txxxxx       (TPC routines)
            - group Vxxxxx       (VDet routines)
            - group Xxxxxx       (Xlti level Trigger routines)

     2. - The first comdeck is VERSION which contains the version #
          and the date of the current version. The next comdeck is NEWS
          which contains last news and modifications.

     3. - A set starts with a *CD setNEWS and ends with a *CD setEND.
          the *CD setNEWS contains a description of the set and a
          description of the modifications made for a new version.

     3. - Documentation is done as follow:
           - variables in COMMON are described in the COMDECK itself
             behind an Historian card *IF DOC
           - There is a *SET DOC which contains *DECK xxDOC with the
             documentation for this set behind a card *IF DOC
           - each subroutine starts with a header of the type:
             SUBROUTINE ASCEVE
        ---------------------------------------------------------------
         - F.RANJARD - 850328
         ! Close the event:
           do analysis
           save event on tape
         - called by    ASPRUN                      from this .HLB
         - calls        ASANAL, AUCGSI, ASWEVE      from this .HLB
                        RDMOUT                      from KERNLIB
        *IF .NOT.DOC
             then the code follows the card *IF .NOT.DOC

     4. - all GEANT3 variables in a COMMON have a 'G' as 1st letter
          when they are real and in 2nd letter when integer.
          So do not use 'G' in 1st or 2nd position of a variable to
          avoid ambiguities.

     5. - All GEANT3 subroutines start with 'G' so DO NOT start GALEPH
          subroutine with 'G'.

     6. - All GEANT3 common blocks start with a 'G' so DO NOT start
          GALEPH common blocks with a 'G'.

     7. - All variables in COMMON have 6 letters of which 2 are the
          2 first letters of the COMMON block name.

     8. - Logical flags start with 'F'.
          Counters or flags set by data cards start with 'I'.
          Counters depending of the event start with 'N'.
          Character lists or flags start with 'T'.
          Maximum number of elements set in a list start with 'M'.
          Integer variables or flags set at the beginning of the
          job and not reset by data cards start with 'J'.
          Absolute pointers into banks start with 'K'.
          Offset inside banks start with 'L'.
          Parameters used to define array dimensions start with 'L'.
