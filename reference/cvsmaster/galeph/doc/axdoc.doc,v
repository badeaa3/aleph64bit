.chapter   INTERACTIVE VERSION
     An interactive graphic version can be set up for development
 and debugging purposes.
   For now , it runs on VAX and IBM-VM/CMS ( provided you get enough virtual
   storage ).
     In this version the user can call one by one and in any order the
  basic functions of the GALEPH Monte-Carlo:
     -Design or modify the geometry description
     -Exploit the drawing package to visualise any set of components
      in an adequate way.
     -Change the running conditions on an event by event basis

.section How to build an interactive job
   To activate this version one must use the Historian flag INTER and
   recompile the following routines:
  ASCEVE,ASIPAC,ASPRUN,AGTPCH,GAXEPH
  Those routines may be compiled on a separate .OBJ file (VAX) or TEXT
 file (VM/CMS) and used in the linking step of your job (GALINT TEXT
 or GALINT.OBJ).
            INTERACTIVE on VAX

  The steering Data cards file must be assigned to FOR007 which will be read by
 the program.
  As the dialogue with the user is under control of ZCEDEX,make sure it is
 available on your machine.
  As in the standard user application job,you can read your own Historian
 correction set and/or fortran and/or binary files in the GALRUN exec:
    Do not forget to include in the .obj files 'USER$LIBRARY:GXINT.OBJ'.

    REMEMBER not to put a DISPLAY 0 card in your steering data cards as this
 would prevent any graphics output from running.

            INTERACTIVE on VM/CMS
  This mode can be obtained via running mode 8 or 9 (or 4 if you have
 already a module) of exec GALRUN.
  You can keep your GALINT TEXT and use it at load time specifying it
 on panel 3 (files). Do not put a DISP 0 card to be able to open a
 capture file. In the ZCEDEX environment in CMS  you can have access
 to some useful CMS commands (FILELIST , XEDIT ...)
.section Specific changes and new  subroutines
   ASCEVE: no automatic standard views are displayed
   ASIEVE: FDISJO flag is activated for every event
   ASPRUN: a special routine is activated which initializes the
           interactive package (GINTRI) and gives control to the
           interactive control routine (GINTER).
   AGTPCH: The maximum turning angle in the field for the TPC is limited
           to 3 degrees (instead of 120) to display nice curling steps.
   GAXEPH: This deck includes a set of subroutines which may be called
           by the interactive commands:
           GTRIG: processes an event and closes it.
           GTRIGI: initialises an event.
           GUKINE: generates kinematics.
           GULAST: job termination.
           GUVIEW: draw some typical views of ALEPH with header and text.
   GUINTI:  Initialisation routine for the drawing partof the program.
            it computes some scaling factors and sets the 'fake' volumes as
             unseen.
.section Interactive commands
    All commands are described in GEANT3 user's guide ,section XINT.
    They are organised in 4 menus:
    -Drawing commands
    -Graphic control commands
    -Geometry commands
    -General control commands
    Among the Graphic contol commands , a useful one is the command
 'CAPTure n '  to create a GKS metafile on unit n.
 The user must be aware that some logical units are reserved for special
 use and that GEANT is not fully protected against such a usage.
 In particular , units 11 to 13 are reserved for ZCEDEX and unit 10
 (unfortunately used by GEANT as an example...) is reserved for GKS.
