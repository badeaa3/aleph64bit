 Tests of the Nonsymmetric Eigenvalue Problem routines

 LAPACK VERSION 3.0, released June 30, 1999 

 The following parameter values will be used:
    M:         0     1     2     3     5    10    16
    N:         0     1     2     3     5    10    16
    NB:        1     3     3     3    20
    NBMIN:     2     2     2     2     2
    NX:        1     0     5     9     1
    NS:        2     4     2     4     6
    MAXB:     20    20     6    10    10

 Relative machine underflow is taken to be    0.222507-307
 Relative machine overflow  is taken to be    0.179769+309
 Relative machine precision is taken to be    0.111022D-15

 Routines pass computational tests if test ratio is less than   20.00


 ZHS routines passed the tests of the error exits ( 66 tests done)
